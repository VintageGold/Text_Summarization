0,"Given the consequences of these barriers, more work needs to be done to reduce their impact on veterans.Telepsychology, or the use of technology to provide mental health services, broadly encompasses a variety of direct formats including videoconferencing, phone, and instant messaging as well as a variety of indirect formats such as email, self-help apps, or websites.
In this article, telepsychology is more narrowly defined as the use of videoconferencing and telephone technologies to provide mental health services in order to reflect that the bulk of the available research is conducted using one of these two mediums.
Furthermore, this increased privacy associated with telepsychology visits can help prevent some of the negative stigma or embarrassment that veterans might experience during face-to-face visits by allowing them to avoid those in-office contacts.Effectiveness of TelepsychologyOne question that must be presented to mental health providers and researchers is whether veteran-focused telepsychology is at least as effective as treatment that is delivered FTF.
Telepsychology has generally been found to be an effective treatment delivery method for common mental health conditions experienced by veterans including the following: PTSD and other trauma and stressor-related disorders, anxiety, depression, intermittent explosive disorder, substance use disorders, etc.For example, Wierwille et al.
Veterans reported statistically significant, high satisfaction ratings suggesting that they were satisfied with treatment, regardless of whether the services were provided through home-based videoconferencing or FTF.As the volume of telepsychology research has grown, review studies have been better able to answer the question of whether telepsychology is as effective as FTF services by examining findings from groups of studies that looked broadly at civilian samples.
The authors reviewed 64 articles that included 9,764 total participants and reported a mean overall medium weighted effect size of d = 0.53 for services delivered through web-based interventions, which the authors noted is also comparable to effect sizes observed in FTF-delivered talk therapies.
The authors reported significant medium to strong improvements in symptoms across all conditions in both telepsychology and FTF conditions, but was unable to determine whether telepsychology and FTF-delivered treatments were equivalent.Our research only noted one review study that focused specifically on veterans.
Furthermore, as technological methods of delivering therapy have evolved, the present study also seeks to examine the differences in the effectiveness of therapy delivered by videoconferencing versus phone.MethodResearch QuestionThe overall research question for this meta-analysis is “Is telepsychology effective for veteran populations?” There are three approaches to answering this question.
After we exhausted all review studies and their reference lists, the research team conducted a broader literature search using various combinations of the following search terms in the PsycInfo, MedLine, and CINAHL databases: telepsychology, telehealth, telemental health, telebehavioral health, teletherapy, telecounseling, tele, phone, videoconferencing, therapy, counseling, psychotherapy, veterans, treatment, disorder, and mental health.
Note that the standard deviation of the change scores is not simply the difference between the standard deviations of the pretest and posttest scores, nor is it the average of the standard deviations of the pretest and posttest scores.Pre–Post Effect SizeBecause this was the only data provided, we made use of it by computing the pre–post effect size by dividing the difference in pretest and posttest mean scores by the average standard deviation of the pretest and posttest scores.Randomized Clinical Trials Effect SizeSome studies used a true randomized clinical trial design to allow for the testing of noninferiority or equivalence of telepsychology to the same therapy-administered FTF.

Most of the effect sizes are in the moderate-to-strong range, and given that most of them are positive numbers, this result indicates that participants’ psychological well-being improved as a result of receiving services through telepsychology.For example, the two psychological conditions studied most frequently were trauma and depression.
Note that there is no way to compute the confidence intervals for these values because the formula for the confidence intervals depends on having the standard deviation of the difference scores, and this information has not been reported in the studies we located for this meta-analysis.For RCT designs, the results for each type of psychological problem are reported in Table 3,TABLES AND FIGUREStable/figure thumbnailTable 3.

However, veterans face a number of mental health problems that telepsychology might be helpful in addressing.Second, very few of the veteran-focused telepsychology studies we identified provided demographic or outcome data on the race, gender, or geographic makeup of their participants.
These data could be helpful in determining whether traditionally underserved veteran subpopulations, such as rural, women, and/or veterans of color populations, for example, are experiencing similar levels of efficacy compared to the average participant.Finally, we noted few veteran-focused telepsychology studies that used samples outside of North America, and especially the United States.
Are telepsychology-delivered services as effective as, and are those services equivalent to FTF-delivered treatments that are provided to veterans in other areas of the world?Future DirectionsBased on the limitations noted above, both for the present study as well as the larger body of telepsychology-focused research, we offer six suggestions for the future research.
Third, future studies should include technology modality as a moderator variable to allow us to better understand whether specific types of telepsychology-based services are more effective with veterans than other modalities.Fourth, too few veteran-focused studies related to web apps, email, computer-only, and text messaging or instant chat to consider adding them to the present study.
As this body of literature expands, more work needs to be done to better understand the role of these other, less often researched modalities of telepsychology to verify whether and/or under what circumstances these other technologies can be effective methods of providing services using meta-analytic techniques.
While the capability of providing behavioral health services with telecommunication technologies has been extended to virtually all clinical aspects of behavioral and mental health practice, such as assessment, consultation, psychoeducation, and treatment, utilizing these technologies in parenting plan evaluations had not been a serious topic prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Finally, because the stakes are so significant, emotions in cases of contested custody typically run high, further compounding what is an already complicated evaluation process.Competent child custody evaluators, both those conducting in-person CCEs as well as those performing RCCEs, must operationalize the best interests task and objectives, understand how multiple methods are used to gather data on factors and psycholegal questions, and know how to use the multitrait-multimethod matrix interpretation principles of data analysis.
Each of these factors is composed of subfactors that address separate factual questions about how the age of the child, the child’s gender, and the child’s cognitive and emotional development will affect current and future parent–child interactions and functioning.In addition, evaluators must recognize any CCE is an assessment of multiple moving targets; people, their circumstances, and their situations may be in a constant state of change in response to the separation or other aspects of the ongoing dispute.
The evaluator manages a process that must assess and investigate required topics, be responsive to opportunities for additional details—which may emerge at any point in the process—and adjust inquiries as the data confirms or disconfirms various hypotheses.The process of any evaluation, whether conducted in person or via VC, is dependent upon a perpetual adaptation of the evaluator’s ability to operationalize best interests considerations and questions, the evaluator’s competence in the use of each of the multiple methods of data collection, and the evaluator’s ability to integrate large amounts of data into a comprehensive understanding of the issues in the case.
If offering an opinion on the ultimate issues of custody and parenting time, evaluators are also expected to consider these factors, and when possible and appropriate, evaluators may use social science research to support their choice of methods, inferences, and opinions.Evaluators are also encouraged to develop case-specific psycholegal questions to guide their inquiry.
Evaluators seek information from five types of independent data sources: document or record review; interviews, including individual interviews of the parties and, when appropriate, the children, as well as joint and group interviews, when appropriate; psychological testing; direct observations of parent–child relationships via home or office visits; and contacts with collateral sources or witnesses.
The variety of interactional reactions that arise in the patient-examiner relationship are neither avoided nor acted upon; rather, they are identified and observed and then used as valuable aids in bringing greater meaning and understanding to the patient’s behavior and attitudes Clinicians should at all times be able to point to the data from which they draw their conclusions and also to trace out explicitly the chain of inferences that led to those conclusions.In sum, each evaluator must design a study of the best interests factors and the psycholegal questions that are relevant to each case.
The two outcome variables are positive therapy outcome and studies demonstrating the equivalence of telemental health services provided by VC with those provided face to face.Empathic Accuracy and the Primary of Auditory and Visual Behaviors Over Nonverbal CuesMany evaluators are concerned that using VC and conducting RCCEs will result in a reduction in what has been termed “empathic accuracy.” Empathic accuracy is “the ability to perceive accurately how another person is feeling”.
As previously described, inquiry into nonverbal behaviors and the disciplined use of the procedures in the conceptual model are designed to address these concerns to the extent that this is possible.Indeed, one small study of the effects of telepsychology format on empathic accuracy and therapeutic alliance found no significant differences on these variables in a comparison of VC, telephone, and face-to-face psychotherapy.
Reasons for this include conveniently finding high-quality services close to home, decreasing time away from both work and school, decreasing costs associated with traveling miles for care, decreasing stresses of travel with a child with a behavior disorder and siblings, decreasing worries about navigating unfamiliar health care settings, allowing additional supporters to attend and work together to coordinate care, and decreasing stigma by connecting to child-friendly settings such as schools.
These same dynamics might apply to the participants in RCCEs.The Substitutability of VC: The Empirical Outcome and Equivalence EvidenceThe use of technologies in mental health and psychological practice has steadily increased over the last decade because studies of the technology demonstrate it can be effectively used to achieve positive, equivalent outcomes.
The authors assert that the consistently positive outcomes and demonstrated equivalence found in these studies support the notion that child custody evaluators, like therapists and other clinical and forensic evaluators, can develop empathic accuracy and working alliances sufficient to produce valid, reliable, and trustworthy child custody evaluations for the courts.VC in Psychotherapy With AdultsThe consensus at this point is that there is sufficient data of efficacy of telepsychology and a lack of data that it is inferior that there is no basis for overriding the choice of an informed client and competent therapist that this is an acceptable alternative under the right circumstances.Numerous reviews of the existing research document the feasibility of using VC in psychotherapy with adults.
Guideline 7 states,When a psychological test or other assessment procedure is conducted via telepsychology, psychologists are encouraged to ensure that the integrity of the psychometric properties of the test or assessment procedure and the conditions of administration indicated in the test manual are preserved when adapted for use with such technologies.The emphasis when using VC is on preserving the conditions of administration outlined in the test manual, whether this is in direct test administration or monitoring of someone completing a self-report instrument.
Videoconferencing may also offer advantages in working with adolescents, including less self-consciousness, increased personal space, and decreased confidentiality concerns as the provider is outside of the local community.VC Use in Therapy With Children and AdolescentsTo be included as a feasible accommodation in an RCCE, evaluators interviewing children using VC must be able to establish rapport with the child, develop adequate cooperation, and develop an alliance sufficient to gather data and information on a wide variety of topics.
The children were interviewed by experienced interviewers 1 to 2 days after they participated in an innocuous event.VC in Parent–Child Therapy, Parent–Child Observations, and Family TherapyThe central purpose of conducting observations of parent–child interactions is to provide an important source of information for assessing parent–child connections and dynamics, to focus on each parent’s ability to respond to the needs of the child, observe a child’s response to each parent, and to consider potential risks and concerns within the parent–child relationship or contextual factors that may impede or facilitate these relationships.Many are concerned that use of VC for parent–child observations may not be feasible or might yield less helpful or less reliable information than in-person observations.
For example, remotely conducted parent–child interaction therapy has been shown to be feasible and to have comparable outcomes to clinic-based treatments with several small subgroups of children with anxiety-related conditions and externalizing youth.In-office PCIT uses real-time, in-session parent coaching where the therapist monitors family interactions from an observation room and provides live, individualized coaching via a parent-worn bug-in-the-ear device.
Critical issues specific to family-based telemental health care include navigating varying levels of technological literacy across generations of participants, deciding which family members to include, ensuring the safety of participant, optimizing therapeutic alliance and engagement of all participants, navigating logistical concerns in conducting sessions, and ensuring privacy.
These developments demonstrate that such technological innovations can be used to overcome many traditional barriers to effective care, but no research on these issues is currently available.The Ethics of Using VC in RCCEsThe practice of telemental health, including VC, involves consideration of ethical standards, legal requirements, telecommunication technologies, and individual practitioner policies and procedures that must be balanced with any other external constraints or demands of the particular professional context.
These guidelines address issues of competence, standards of care in the delivery of telepsychology services, informed consent, confidentiality of data and information, security and transmission of data and information, disposal of data and information and technologies, testing and assessment, and interjurisdictional practice.However, the geographical distance between the provider and service recipient and the use of technology as the medium of service provision introduce additional risks and considerations that extend beyond those of conventional in-person services.
In its guidelines for informed consent when using video-based technology, the ATA identified several situation-specific conditions that must be addressed as part of ethical telemental health practice.Evaluators using VC to conduct RCCEs must meet the ethical standards of their respective disciplines and apply these ethical standards to the virtual task.
These include “Evidence-Based Practice for Telemental Health” in 2009, “Practice Guidelines for Videoconferencing-Based Telemental Health” in 2009, “Practice Guidelines for Video-Based Online Mental Health Service” in 2013, “A Lexicon of Assessment and Outcome Measures for Telemental Health” in 2013, and “Practice Guidelines for Telemental Health with Children and Adolescents” in 2017.Deviations from the guidelines may be acceptable, but departures from customary protocols must be justified.If circumstances warrant, a practitioner may responsibly pursue a course of action different from the guidelines when, in the reasonable judgment of the practitioner, such action is indicated by the condition of the patient, restrictions or limits on available resources, or advances in information or technology subsequent to publication of the guidelines.
While no studies have specifically identified any patient subgroup that does not benefit from, or is harmed by, mental health care provided through remote VC, professionals using VC must determine that interviewees are intellectually, emotionally, physically, linguistically, and functionally capable of using the technology.
Patients with a history of adverse reactions to treatment or those who are at high risk of harm to self or others may not be appropriate for telemental assessment.Providers are expected to consider geographic location, technological competence, medical conditions, mental status and stability, psychiatric diagnosis, current or historic use of substances, treatment history, and therapeutic needs that may be relevant to assessing the appropriateness of the services offered.
While telemental health developed out of a need in underserved rural population areas, patients in densely populated areas also have benefitted from decreased travel times caused by high traffic volumes that make traveling even short distances a problem.Defending VC in RCCEs in Court: The Evidentiary ArgumentEvaluators choosing to use VC in RCCEs may face challenges in court about whether their methods meet the legal standards for admissibility of expert testimony found in the Daubert trilogy and/or the Frye case for admissibility of expert testimony.
By following these principles, evaluators performing RCCEs can produce valid and reliable reports that will help courts in their efforts to revolve custody disputes.ConclusionThe COVID-19 pandemic has at least temporarily and perhaps permanently changed the landscape of mental health service delivery, including the conduct of child custody evaluations.
Regardless of whether a CCE is conducted in person or remotely via VC, evaluators must be able to describe and explain their choices of how they investigated the relevant factors and the psycholegal questions that were the foci of the evaluation and the ways analysis connects the data and facts to their conclusions and recommendations.This article details the growth of the telemedicine and telemental health communities over the past 10 to 15 years from an alternative to reach underserved populations to an alternative within the mainstream mental health professions.
Accessibility is increasingly important, considering approximately 20% of jail inmates across the United States are housed in rural jails, most of which are difficult to reach and do not have on-site treatment providers.There is sound reasoning for why forensic e-mental health is a good option for the evaluation and intervention of justice-involved individuals.
In many forensic settings, medication management is the extent of mental health treatment available.Although the COVID-19 crisis has been unique, it provided impetus for the field to critically examine forensic mental health practice, research, and policy and their relationships with technology.
Although the experimental conditions lacked ecological validity, findings demonstrated adequate interrater reliabilities across the evaluator groups, which provided support that remote BPRS-V and MacCAT-CA administration was not a significant departure from local administration, and can potentially serve as a reliable component of evaluating competence to proceed.A randomized controlled trial of competency evaluations using another tool—the Georgia Court Competency Test–Mississippi State Hospital revision—demonstrated similar results.
Prudent evaluators will consult ethical codes, specialty guidelines, and clinical manuals specific to forensic psychology for determining appropriate use before seeking Internet-based data.Forensic InterventionIn a 2012 practitioner survey, psychotherapists projected that technology would play a key role in psychotherapy by the year 2020.
Smartphone apps can track moods and physiological functioning, facilitate skills acquisition, serve as virtual coaches, time-stamp mental health-related “assignments,” come preprogrammed with psychoeducation resources and crisis contact information, act as reminders for therapy or other appointments, and provide GPS navigation and monitoring.While general psychotherapy e-mental health has proliferated, forensic e-mental health treatment and intervention has inched behind.
Forensic e-mental health interventions are potential solutions for treating complex mental health needs and reaching difficult-to-access individuals, such as those who lack transportation, live in rural areas, or are less mobile due to disability or medical vulnerabilities.One novel program, Sober IPT aimed to reduce substance use upon community reentry by maintaining continuum of care for justice-involved women with major depressive disorder and co-occurring substance use disorders.
Although there was no control condition in this study and its sample size was small, participant feedback allowed the authors to conclude that the continuum of care “pocket case manager” was worthwhile.Substance UseAlthough the evidence bases for forensic-specific e-mental health is quite limited, foundational work on “forensic-adjacent” issues can inform forensic e-mental health practice.
Treatment adherence, substance use, therapeutic alliance, and client satisfaction were similar across groups, although overall participants reported preferring e-mental health due to its increased accessibility.
Although mobile technology may be promising with this treatment group, interventions should go above and beyond treatment linkage and completion, and address criminogenic as well as service needs in order to maximize results.Regarding specific psychotherapeutic orientations, cognitive behavior therapy has garnered a strong track record with respect to treating justice-involved persons.
The following policy considerations are offered.Need for Professional ConsensusWhen the United States began to feel the major effects of COVID-19, psychologists looked to professional organizations, colleagues, test developers, technology experts, and literature on conducting work via e-means.
In the future, we may see a move away from using technology to mimic in-person care, and increased use of artificial intelligence, robotics, metrics and data mining, mobile apps, and virtual reality in workflow and treatment configurations.As noted by Batastini et al., joint ventures between academic and community-based collaborators as resources can be helpful in implementing forensic e-mental health.
The group lobbied state legislature, and a new law was passed that allowed for billing if at least one Medicaid-eligible provider is present at the remote site.Training and EducationPsychology-law is a fast-growing area of clinical expertise, which can require training and education in assessment, intervention, and research across a range of settings.
Psychiatry colleagues have also provided 12 guidelines for graduate medical education in telepsychiatry, including awareness of the remote location’s resources, understanding the laws and ethics related to e-mental health, recognizing when e-mental health practice is appropriate for a particular client, and considering issues of test integrity.Of course, training and education do not conclude with graduation.
A survey of forensic practitioners noted ethical and legal concerns along with limitations in conducting psychological assessments via videoconference as most problematic.If and when the time comes, large scale implementation of forensic e-mental health will require a significant culture shift within the scientific and clinical fields, as well as within institutions that are, historically, slow to evolve.
Given its ease, accessibility, and widespread use during COVID-19, it is likely that forensic e-mental health will persist in many practice, research, and policy contexts once there is a “return to normal.” It is our hope that the COVID-19-necessaitated technology zeitgeist provides impetus for exciting innovations in the field of forensic psychology.
The uncertain duration of this new professional reality has constrained therapists in ways that no one could have predicted and has required significant adjustments to be made and creativity to be employed in terms of finding new ways to work remotely and effectively from home offices that were perhaps never originally intended to serve as therapeutic spaces.In this mixed-method study, we focused on assessing psychotherapists’ challenges providing psychotherapy services from home during the Covid-19 pandemic.
However, they reported that the participants expressed some confusion about how to set boundaries with clients during the therapeutic interaction when providing online therapy and their ability to trust technology.Békés et al.’s survey on therapists’ experiences of practicing psychotherapy or psychoanalysis remotely during Covid-19 yielded similar results.
Those who experienced a higher level were younger in age, had relatively less clinical experience, and had past negative experiences with remote treatment.MethodProcedureUpon receiving ethical approval from the Human Research and Ethics Committee of Long Island University, we recruited mental health professionals through dedicated and diverse professional listservs designed for social workers, psychologists, and art therapists.
Ninety-two therapists agreed to participate in an online survey that included demographic questions as well as questions about their perceptions of the therapeutic alliance and their professional and personal experiences providing remote treatment during the pandemic.
The survey included positively and negatively worded questions that were reversed during the analysis to increase consistency.For the qualitative phase of the study, we developed an interview guide with 15 questions that was based on the recent literature and empirical data on remote therapy during the pandemic.
The participants used both phone and online platforms, such as Zoom and Webex and Doxy, a combination of a phone and online platform, and other online platforms such as FaceTime, Skype, WhatsApp, and Google Meet to provide therapy.The results are divided into seven categories of challenges and outcomes that are “solutions” or adjustments that our participants found or made in order to cope with the difficulties they experienced because of the pandemic and the transition to remote work: shared trauma, adjustment without preparation, psychotherapy with children, Zoom fatigue, lack of privacy, psychotherapy with new clients, and negotiating physical and relational space/re-creating boundaries.
As a matter of fact, only 18.5% of the participants reported taking an online course/training in telehealth before or during the pandemic.For those participants who worked in institutional practices as opposed to private practices, the lack of regulations on the preferred Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act–compliant platforms through which to communicate with patients, access to medical records from personal computers, and the client’s ability to sign documents also made the transition more challenging.
Participant D.F. shared,I do not feel like I miss a lot of cues because I’m not seeing all of them; plus, in a way, the way Zoom works, you’re seeing them so close up it’s like you see every little flicker of the tiny muscles around their eyes in a way that you wouldn’t necessarily if they were sitting a normal sort of therapeutic distance from you.The camera view forced participants to be more attuned and to pay closer attention to their clients’ subtle nuances.OutcomeThe majority of our participants found that having the support of their peers, supervision groups, families, and friends—as well as engaging in self-care practices, such as yoga and exercise—was extremely helpful in coping with the emotional and psychological effects of the pandemic, including Zoom fatigue.
Thus, further research is needed on how conducting therapy from home affects privacy and confidentiality.Implications for the Future of Psychotherapy Post-Covid-19One of the most important findings of our study is that as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, therapists, clients, managed care companies, and other significant stakeholders have been given the chance to learn that teletherapy is not only possible but also necessary.
We believe that such training will facilitate the work for clinicians, improve the therapeutic connection, and, most important, create professional standards for this new way of working.The results of this study also revealed different sets of challenges for therapists working with children as opposed to adults.
Furthermore, in response to declarations of emergency, psychology boards in several states including Arizona, California, and Texas suspended typical interjurisdictional requirements to allow psychologists not licensed within their state to provide treatment in their jurisdiction.Many professional psychology training programs and clinics moved rapidly to telepsychology with tele-supervision, and the Association of Psychology Postdoctoral and Internship Centers facilitated this, communicating that training hours via telepsychology could be counted the same as in-person.
Even when clinical settings have procured the necessary technology, technical issues on either the clinician’s or patient’s end can hinder willingness to use telepsychology.Current StudyThe flexibility and adaptability of telehealth and telepsychology services have been touted as an important part of crisis response plans, as telehealth allows professionals to provide services to hot zones rapidly or without having to be there in person at all.
To remain consistent with Medicare’s expanded definition during the pandemic, within the current study, “telepsychology” was defined as “the use of real-time audio and/or video conferencing technology to provide psychological services.” It was hypothesized that telepsychology use would increase dramatically during the pandemic relative to before the pandemic, and that this increase in use would lead psychologists to anticipate continuing to use telepsychology at higher rates after the pandemic relative to baseline, though less than during the pandemic.
Summary of Participant CharacteristicsView larger image > in this page > in new window> Download slideMeasuresIn addition to demographic data about themselves, their practice location and setting, and treatment foci, participants were asked to provide responses regarding their telepsychology use, training, and organizational policies relative to January 20, 2020, when the first COVID-19 case was confirmed in the United States.
To remain consistent with this trend and, in particular, the expansion of telepsychology reimbursement during the pandemic under Medicare, telepsychology was defined to participants as the use of real-time audio and/or video conferencing technology to provide psychological services.The researcher-generated telepsychology questions used were: “What percentage of your patient treatment is provided using telepsychology?” with answers ranging from 0%-100%; “I have been trained well to use telepsychology,” with a 7-point, Likert-type scale ranging from 1 to 7; and “My organizational policies support telepsychology,” measured on the same Likert-type scale.
For all three questions, participants responded three times with regard to the following prompts: “Before the COVID-19 pandemic began in the U.S. on January 20, 2020”; “During the COVID-19 pandemic in the U.S.”; and “Your anticipated perspective or behaviors after the COVID-19 pandemic ends in the U.S.” The amount of change for the current primary analyses was determined by subtracting participants’ responses about their telepsychology use before the pandemic from their answers during the pandemic.ProcedurePotential participants were sent a recruitment e-mail inviting them to complete a 10-min survey that would “help inform treatment approaches used during the pandemic, as well as public healthcare policy.” To avoid biasing enrollment based on preconceived notions of telepsychology, no reference to telepsychology was made in the recruitment e-mail.
For these four ANOVAs only, this resulted in not including participants who worked in correctional facilities, geriatric facilities, psychiatric hospitals, rehabilitation centers, residential treatment centers, or other practice settings.Finally, two multiple regression analyses were conducted to examine the statistical effects of participant demographics, change in workplace telepsychology policy, change in telepsychology training, practice geographic area, and treatment focus on the change in the percentage of clinical work conducted via telepsychology before relative to during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The second model’s predictors included dummy-coded variables representing a variety of issues and diagnoses the psychologists’ treated within their practice.ResultsChanges in Telepsychology Use Over TimeThe repeated-measures ANOVA examining the effects of time on the percentage of clinical work performed via telepsychology was statistically significant, F(2, 2617) = 8254.01, p < .001, partial eta-squared = .863, a very large-sized effect.
After the pandemic, there were no statistical differences between groups, although in terms of the means, psychologists in VA medical centers projected that they would use telepsychology the most in their practice.Demographics, Training, and Organizational PoliciesThe first multiple regression provided a statistically significant prediction of change in telepsychology use during the COVID-19 pandemic relative to before, F(6, 2612) = 34.94, p < .001, R2 = .074, a small-sized effect.
Significant Variables in Multiple Regression 2View larger image > in this page > in new window> Download slidePsychologists who treated antisocial personality disorder, who performed testing and evaluation, and who worked with rehabilitation populations had the lowest increases in percentage telepsychology use.
Conversely, psychologists treating relationship issues, anxiety, and women’s issues had the highest increases in percentage telepsychology use.DiscussionThe current study is among the first to examine United States psychologists’ percentage of clinical work performed via telepsychology before, during, and projected after the COVID-19 pandemic, and to examine demographic, training, policy, and clinical practice predictors of these changes.
Subsequent analyses also demonstrated the statistical effects of specific demographic, training, policy, and clinical practice characteristics on the change in use of telepsychology, suggesting that psychologists may be differentially able or willing to incorporate it into their own practice.These findings document an unprecedented shift in the uptake of telepsychology, as rates of utilization increased dramatically during the pandemic.
Psychologists reported increasing the percentage of their clinical work via telepsychology at record rates, even within the VHA, where training and infrastructure have been in place for over a decade.These results are also notable because they document the efforts of practicing psychologists to meet the increased mental health needs of the public.
Despite the lack of age effects, the mean age and experience of the sample indicate that many participants probably trained in an era with less video conferencing technology; therefore many of these psychologists likely learned this approach and adapted rapidly during the demands of the COVID-19 pandemic.These findings have several important implications.
For example, given that women tend to provide the majority of childcare, woman-identifying psychologists with children may have experienced a greater need to increase telepsychology use in order to facilitate provision of care at home after schools and childcare options were closed.
This is reinforced by the finding that psychologists in VA medical centers reported higher percentage use before COVID-19 than psychologists in all other primary practice settings except individual practice, given VHA’s history of telepsychology infrastructure and accessibility of training.Finally, the current study explored therapeutic issues and diagnoses associated with increased telepsychology use during the pandemic in comparison to telepsychology use prior to the pandemic.
However, these results also suggest that these issues may be particularly amenable to treatment via telepsychology or that psychologists are more open to providing services for these concerns using telepsychology.Clinical and Training ImplicationsThe substantial changes in percentage of telepsychology use observed in the current study suggest that many of the previously documented barriers to telepsychology have been addressed, at least on a temporary basis, either by procedural changes or by the immediate needs of patients and providers during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Adequate training in telepsychology and supportive organizational policies and procedures appear to be an important component in increasing use, and are likely to continue to be a crucial factor in maintaining telepsychology use after risks of in-person health care associated with COVID-19 have lessened.
Moreover, future interventions and research could be targeted at clinical issues associated with lower rates of uptake; for example, the findings regarding testing and evaluation suggest a need for valid computer adapted assessments that patients can complete from their homes without violating administration norms or test security practices.Limitations and Future DirectionsThe findings from the current study should be interpreted within the context of several limitations.
For example, if the United States continues to experience high rates of positive cases in the absence of a widely available vaccine or effective treatments, it is possible that rates of telepsychology use may continue to increase, as patients may feel that they can no longer wait to access services.The survey questions did not ask participants to differentiate between their use of video-conferencing and telephone in the definition of telepsychology and/or video conferencing technology”), which was consistent with CMS definitions.
The U.S. Health Resources & Services Administration reports that 112 million people are living within areas with a shortage of mental health providers and services.Telepsychology can be an important piece of the puzzle as psychologists attempt to reach people for whom time, distance, or situation are barriers to receiving traditional in-person psychotherapy.
Although this can include the use of text, chat, e-mail, telephone, virtual reality, or even websites providing self-help information, this article will focus solely on the delivery of psychotherapy through the use of videoconferencing technology.Numerous studies indicate telepsychology can be as effective as in-person interventions.
Finally, a suitable plan must be in place in the event the network connection fails or when a client is in crisis, including knowledge of emergency services and important contacts within the client’s area.Adding to the list of potential telepsychology deterrents, reimbursement for telepsychology sessions from public health care programs and health insurance providers can be difficult.
In response to anticipated health care needs and to facilitate social distancing to slow transmission rates, multiple agencies within the United States adjusted key policies to promote the use of telehealth and telepsychology to meet demand for services.
As a final check for validity, participants were asked to provide a response the question, “In one sentence or less, what do you think the purpose of this study was?”MeasuresDemographicsSurvey items recorded participant responses concerning their age, years in practice as a psychologist, the number of psychologists in their place of practice, their theoretical approach to psychotherapy, if they currently use telepsychology, the primary focus on their practice, the states they are licensed to practice within, and the density of the community.
Race/ethnicity was indicated by selecting from a predefined a list of forced choices comprising White/European American, Black/African American, Latino/Hispanic, Asian/Asian American, American Indian/Alaska Native/Native American, multiracial/multiethnic, and “other.” The item capturing theoretical approach responses offered a list of forced choices, including Acceptance and Commitment, Cognitive Behavioral, Existential, Family Systems, Feminist, Gestalt, Individual/Adlerian, Interpersonal, Jungian, Narrative, Person-Centered/Rogerian, Psychoanalysis, Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy, Reality Therapy, Solution-Focused Therapy, and “other.” Participants who selected “other” were provided a text box and asked, “please specify.”DeterrentsParticipants were asked, “If you DO NOT currently use telepsychology, what led to this decision?.” Participants were allowed to select multiple items.ResultsDescriptive AnalysisTo summarize psychologists’ deterrents to using telepsychology, percentages of psychologists in the sample who endorsed the researcher-provided options were calculated.
Variables in Logistic RegressionsView larger image > in this page > in new window> Download slidePredictor variables included participant age, as well as binary predictor variables of masculine gender, White/European American race/ethnicity, practicing within a rural community, practicing within a VA or medical center, and using cognitive–behavioral therapy as a treatment approach to therapy.TrainingThe first logistic regression model did not provide a statistically significant prediction of psychologists endorsing insufficient training as a concern, χ2(6) = 9.132, p = .166.SafetyThe second model provided a statistically significant prediction of endorsing safety as a concern, χ2(6) = 27.193, p < .000.
This study helps clarify the most important deterrents psychologists face when considering telepsychology within their own practice.The results indicate that psychologists not using telepsychology primarily chose not to do so because they believed the effectiveness of treatment would be diminished and that they had concerns about exposing their clients to increased risks.
These concerns included receiving insufficient training to be effective with telepsychology, ensuring the client’s safety or addressing the needs of remote clients in crisis, protecting the privacy of clients, considering ethical issues that could result from using telepsychology, and being uncertain about the effectiveness of treatment when not conducted in person.
Providing more information and training resources could potentially encourage more psychologists to consider its use and provide more mental health care access to populations that traditional in-person approaches do not currently reach.
Not just limited to academic and mental health evaluations, during the COVID-19 crisis, those from the most vulnerable populations have the least access to services they need.Between an identified shortage of school psychologists in rural areas and many school psychologists, who spend the overwhelming majority of their time doing psychoeducational testing and related services working at over twice the capacity recommended by the National Association of School Psychologists, a redistribution of resources is necessary.
Even though some general guidance has been provided for how to adapt tests generally to a remote, online format during the COVID-19 crisis, this is not a replacement for systematic research on the equivalence of testing in this format to a traditional, in-person administration.Given the range of psychological processes engaged during the course of a typical cognitive evaluation, altering the format of administration could in theory alter the tasks, and thus the emerging data, significantly.
The generalizability of any findings should be limited to trained test administrators who follow the specific protocol examined, as closely as possible, including specific digital platform requirements, examiner training, and use of an informed in-person proctor.MethodEquivalence Study DesignFor the present study, a case control match design was utilized, in which examinees took the WISC-V in only one format.
These constraints are well addressed in other reviews and are beyond the scope of the current paper; however, information about the actual clinical practice of telepsychology is lacking.Regarding the logistical and practical delivery of telepsychology services, a survey of telepsychology experts found that adaptations to treatment protocols were recommended for three domains: use of self-report questionnaires, treatment handouts, and in-session examples.
The term “in-session examples” refers to the use of visual aids such as a whiteboard or diagram to illustrate a point, facilitate attentional practice, and aid in the evaluation of a treatment target.Suitable adaptations in the three recommended domains are demonstrated in the following case series in which telepsychology was utilized to deliver evidence-based treatments to an active duty military population.
Informed consent was obtained from all individual participants included in the study.The treatment context for these cases is that these were all active duty service members who were treated in military hospitals via telepsychology by clinicians who were located at a different military hospital.
and to make careful adaptations to the following domains use of self-report questionnaires, treatment handouts, and in-session examples, to ensure high quality care is being delivered.Summary and Future DirectionsEvidence-based psychotherapies and pharmacological therapies can be delivered effectively through telepsychology; this is well established in the literature.
Implementation of BPT as a first-line intervention is critical in order to improve the lives of youth with DBDs and reduce familial and societal burden.Graduate programs increased emphasis on evidence-based interventions and state requirements for, and availability of, continuing education courses have led to increased opportunities for training in EBIs. However, data suggest that graduate school training in EBIs for childhood psychiatric disorders is relatively rare when compared with adult-focused EBIs. Moreover, although individual training elements are often utilized in graduate training, their combination, which is considered best practices, is less common.
Research has found that using interactive, web-based tutorials combined with live remote coaching can significantly improve therapeutic skills and knowledge.The purpose of the present pilot study was to develop and test a technological platform for training mental health professionals in BPT.
Overall, the findings of this preliminary study are encouraging and indicate high potential for the BPT technology training platform to meet a significant limitation in the field, namely, limited access to engaging, efficient, and effective approaches to training mental health providers in BPT.
The data strongly suggest that this platform serves as a strong foundation for learning BPT specifically and CBT approaches more generally.The study had limitations that provide important context to better understand the findings and also point to future directions in this line of research and clinical training.
In this regard, future development and research efforts must focus on incorporating other common BPT skills, understanding whether the live remote coaching results in incremental effects over the web-based tutorial, considering how best to further support individuals who respond differently to initial training efforts, considering what additional approaches may be needed to ensure maintenance of training effects over time, and ensuring translation of clinical skills from analogue to actual naturalistic practice contexts.
More recently, results of a similar 2018 meta-analysis of two-dozen RCT noninferiority studies indicated telepsychology is as effective as in-person therapy when treating individuals diagnosed with anxiety, depression, PTSD, and adjustment disorder.Telepsychology practitioners in the United States must comply with a complex set of state laws and federal requirements outlined within the Affordable Care Act, H.R. 4872 and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996.
point out the substantial need for tools to assist clinicians as they sort through available technologies and objectively determine which ones are clinically appropriate for their practice.Psychologists using telepsychology expecting financial reimbursement from health insurance companies or publicly funded health care programs must first verify for each client if, and under what conditions, the third party will reimburse them for their services.
These factors include individual characteristics such as older age, female sex, White race/ethnicity, fewer years of experience, treatment setting, treatment focus, and organizational culture.Results from a study of 322 clinical service workers representing 51 different mental health programs for children, adolescents, and their families indicate adoption of EBPs depends on organizational qualities and individual attributes.
Topics emphasized among those interested in further training were ethical and legal issues, efficacy data including research comparing telepsychology with traditional modalities, safety/crisis information, reimbursement procedures, system costs, and training in setting up a telepsychology practice.The purpose of the current study is to identify significant demographic, organizational, and clinical factors of psychologists’ use of telepsychology within their practice.
The sample also had representation from all 50 states, as well as each treatment focus and approach proposed within the survey.MeasuresParticipants were asked to provide demographic data about themselves, and information about their practice including their practice location, training and current use of telepsychology, and whether policies permitting telepsychology exist within their organization.
Participants were asked, “What is your theoretical therapeutic approach?” and “What is the treatment focus of your primary mental health services setting?” Most of these items were simple demographic items commonly used in psychology research studies, and no formal scales had been developed to date assessing the constructs in any more comprehensive way.
These results align with a study by Aarons indicating that practitioners within wraparound programs for children and families were more likely to adopt new EBPs. Also, parents receiving counseling via telepsychology rated their satisfaction with the experience very highly, in part because it was easier to fit sessions into their schedules by avoiding commute times.On the other hand, psychologists were less likely to use telepsychology if they practiced within a rural area.
It may be the case that rural practitioners judge their resources are too limited to acquire and support a telepsychology platform, although future research on this topic is required.Psychologists focused on treatment compliance/medication management, bipolar disorder, obesity, grief, and antisocial personality were less likely to use telepsychology.
Another potential area for further research is to understand why rural psychologists reported a lower likelihood of adopting telepsychology compared with nonrural ones, despite the benefits of a larger pool of prospective clients across the state(s) in which they are licensed, and the improved access to mental health services for rural populations.Finally, the current study did not seek to determine what barriers to adoption exist for psychologists across a variety of treatment emphases.
Asking these questions in future research could elucidate what features are required to facilitate different interventions, and indicate which ones are not currently adaptable and where psychologists perceive current methods and technologies fall short of what is needed to engender lasting and substantive support for demonstrably effective interventions using the technology.ConclusionsPsychologists were more likely to engage in telepsychology if they had received specific training in it, or practice in a setting with policies supporting the use of telepsychology.
This is likely attributable in part to difficulties accessing specialized services or traditional in-office care resulting from injury-related barriers such as fatigue and motor problems, as well as general barriers to help-seeking such as living in rural areas, lack of transportation, and lack of time.In recent years, the advent of inexpensive videoconferencing programs, integrated web or phone cameras, and ever-expanding Internet access have made the possibility of delivering physical and behavioral health interventions via web-based platforms increasingly feasible and cost-effective.
We expected clinicians to report online delivery to be similar to face-to-face on most dimensions examined, with some areas where online delivery is favorable and others where face-to-face delivery is preferable.MethodParticipantsClinicians, including licensed psychologists, psychology fellows, and advanced doctoral students, who delivered telepsychology interventions to children/adolescents and families impacted by pediatric TBI as part of a series of eight clinical trials were invited to participate.
In describing this during the interviews, some clinicians reported having to work harder to deliver telepsychology, as they needed to be cognizant of multiple factors, such as, technological aspects of the intervention, attending to nonverbal communication, and addressing disruptions during sessions.Other dimensions that were rated similarly included completion of homework, as well as parent and child engagement.
Although not possible in the current project, future research would benefit from understanding the characteristics of families and children who preferred face-to-face treatment and the extent to which those characteristics dovetailed with the therapist’s perspectives.The current findings must be understood in the context of the study’s limitations, which include a relatively small sample of predominantly female clinicians who were specifically hired to conduct telepsychology, and thus may not be representative of the broader population of psychologists.
Research Evaluating the Effectiveness of Synchronous Telemedicine-Delivered Psychological Interventions for Clients With High-Prevalence Mental Health ConditionsView larger image > in this page > in new window> Download slideThe results of these quality assessments were then used to inform the overall strength of the evidence.Ranking the Overall EvidenceThe evidence was evaluated using five criteria: the strength of the evidence, in terms of the quality, quantity, and design of the included studies; the direction of the findings; the consistency of the findings across the included studies; and the generalizability and applicability of the findings to the population of interest, as defined by the PICO.
In addition to this, there were several other high-quality individual RCTs. The direction of the evidence was judged to be positive, since all studies except for one reported that telephone-delivered therapy was as effective as standard in-person treatment or was better than TAU on a range of outcomes.
Taken together, the high strength, positive direction, high consistency, moderate to high generalizability, and high applicability of the VTC studies led to the use of VTC-delivered telepsychology for clients with mental health conditions being ranked as “Supported.”Internet-Delivered Text-Based TreatmentsThree studies were identified that investigated the effectiveness of psychotherapy delivered via the Internet, in which therapists and clients communicated in real time through type-written responses.
Given the positive direction, low to moderate consistency, moderate generalizability, high applicability, but low strength of the evidence, the effectiveness of Internet-delivered text-based interventions for the treatment of mental health conditions, including depression, anxiety, PTSD, and adjustment disorder, was considered to be “Unknown.”DiscussionThe aim of this REA was to assess the effectiveness of telepsychology for clients with depression, anxiety, PTSD, or adjustment disorders.
Veterans are a specific population who may benefit from VTC interventions, given that they are a group with particularly high rates of mental health conditions and with documented barriers to accessing appropriate evidence-based treatments.
This is likely to be the reason for a proliferation of recent research into telepsychology-delivered interventions in veteran populations particularly.The evidence for Internet-delivered text-based synchronous interventions for mental health conditions was limited and primarily consisted of two RCTs judged to be of only moderate quality due to a lack of control of selection bias.
Given the lack of high-quality evidence in this area, the use of Internet-delivered text-based synchronous interventions for mental health conditions was ranked as “Unknown,” indicating that there is insufficient evidence of a beneficial effect, and further methodologically rigorous research across different populations and mental health conditions is needed.The technology involved in telepsychology interventions is relatively new, particularly in the case of VTC-delivered interventions.
Treatments that rely less on specialized human resources like mobile health, if feasible and effective, could create scalable approaches at a population level, particularly in collaboration with pediatricians/primary care providers.Video adult studies and guidelines preceded child and adolescent developments related to assessment, management, collaborative care and guidelines.
Child and adolescent patients, parents, and families have played an instrumental role in many ways: development and pretesting technology; ensuring wearable sensors really work day-to-day; and providing feedback to for visuals, chat options, and communication methods with clinicians.Competencies in information technology were suggested as part of health care reform in 2003.
Clinicians need to plan to review data or be prompted, and then adjust treatment plans “in time” rather than waiting until the next in-person or video visit.The new asynchronous competencies for behavioral health for trainingThis review uses the six ACGME domains, which are Patient Care, Medical Knowledge, System-Based Practice, Professionalism, Practice-Based Learning and Improvement, and Interpersonal and Communication Skills.
For integrating asynchronous technologies, focus areas are: Patient-Centered Care; Evaluation and Outcomes; Roles/Needs of Participants; Teams, Professions, and Systems Within Institutions; and the Academic Health Center Institutional Structure, Process, and Administration.DiscussionWhen used to their best capacity, asynchronous technologies improve access, reduce costs, facilitate teamwork, and include family and caregivers via new workflows.
The complete list of searched terms is as follows:TMH-V terms: telemental health, tele-mental health, telepsychiatry, telepsychotherapy, telepsychology, teletherapy, e-therapy, online therapy, online counseling, OR [(telehealth, telemedicine, telecare, video*, communication tech*) AND]Provider terms: provider*, clinician*, psychiatrist*, psychologist*, stakeholder*, nurse*, professional*, physician*, social work*, personnel*Attitude terms: attitude*, perception*, experience*, interest*, opinion*, view*, utilization, satisfactionThe first author screened the titles and abstracts of the articles resulting from this search and identified those appropriate for full-text review.
Consulting with another provider by videoconference, or the use of alternative technologies such as secure messaging, store and forward communications, or web-based treatment protocols did not qualify.Information from the perspective of the provider who conducted/would be conducting the TMH-V session with the patient versus from a primary care or emergency room doctor requesting a TMH-V consult.Qualitative and/or quantitative data collected using an explicitly identified measure, such as a survey or semi-structured interview.
Providers conducted both TMH-V and in-person sessions in four intervention studies included in this review: a randomized controlled trial of psychologists completing a cognitive behavioral therapy protocol for bulimia, an RCT of psychiatrists providing medication management and supportive counseling, a non-RCT in which psychologists conducted clinical intake interviews, and a non-RCT in which psychiatrists provided school-based medication management and assessment to children.
Two of the studies included in the current review surveyed providers' attitudes toward telemental health technologies more broadly, with only TMH-V results reported here.
Future studies should also examine whether there may be discipline-level variability in providers' attitudes toward TMH-V that may relate to differences in typical encounter characteristics; for instance, whether prescribing clinicians with less frequent and shorter appointments with their patients may have more positive views toward TMH-V than psychologists with longer and more frequent sessions.The finding that providers' positivity toward TMH-V may have outweighed various barriers to use could have important implications when attempting to implement this technology in practice.
Only five of the included studies in this review delivered TMH-V to patients' homes, and four of those studies were published in the past three years, highlighting the relative novelty of this modality and the need for additional research to understand possible effects of TMH-V delivery location on provider and patient perceptions as well as clinical outcomes.Yet importantly, current findings reveal that providers prefer in-person contact when given the choice.
In addition to the distance and time barriers, patients and families also report that they utilize telepsychotherapy to decrease costs associated with traveling long distances for care and to decrease stigma by connecting to child friendly locations such as schools.Current evidence provides some support that services delivered via telehealth are efficacious in addressing a number of disorders in youth such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, obsessive–compulsive disorder, disruptive and oppositional behavior, depression, PTSD, and other mental health problems.
The program receives referrals from schools, child advocacy centers, law enforcement agencies, mental health clinics, and other community agencies and provides assessment, TF-CBT treatment, and psychiatric medication management services as needed.Broader inclusionary criteria for the current study were as follows: patient age between 7 and 18 years; at least one remembered/reported trauma on the University of California at Los Angeles PTSD Reaction Index; significant experience of posttraumatic stress, defined by self-report of at least three current symptoms of PTSD according to DSM–5 criteria; presence of a caregiver who could participate in treatment as needed; experience of at least one barrier to accessing traditional office-based treatment; and caregiver consent and child assent.
Special considerations for the format of treatment included ensuring that all individuals present announced themselves, backup plans were made to conduct sessions by phone in the event of an Internet outage or technical malfunction, and specific procedures to handle potential safety issues remotely.Patient and caregiver engagementCaregiver participation is an important component of TF-CBT, but also a simultaneously challenging issue in child mental health treatment in terms of effectively engaging caregivers, particularly in a school-based environment..
The present open pilot trial of TF-CBT offers one of the first evaluations of the use of telepsychotherapy to remotely deliver TF-CBT in community-based locations, and findings supported the preliminary feasibility and effectiveness of this novel treatment delivery format with trauma-exposed children and adolescents.
Further work to establish the effectiveness of delivering trauma-focused treatment for youth through telepsychotherapy could promote sustainability of these interventions that can help to reduce the burden of suffering for families who are underserved by typical office-based models of care.The present pilot study provides preliminary evidence of the ability to successfully deliver TF-CBT via telepsychotherapy technology, resulting in clinically meaningful symptom change posttreatment with low treatment attrition among trauma-exposed children and adolescents ages 7–18.
As Chou, Bry, and Comer note, in order to position technology-based treatments for optimal uptake and reach, research needs to examine these treatments in the very populations that they are envisioned to serve.Drawing on a “treatment as usual” comparison—in which control participants are provided the standard of care that is routinely given to that population in their own community—increases the portability of a trial and allows the investigator to examine a telemental health couple or family intervention in more remote and underserved populations.
Because clinicians incorporating blended BITs provide the majority of clinical work in face-to-face sessions, the level of training to provide quality intervention is equally as high as training an in-person provider who does not use BITs. Furthermore, the provider’s ability to interact with the client via BITs is limited by the provider’s availability, therapy training, and knowledge of the technology.How Does One Design and Implement a BIT?After deciding to build a couple or family BIT, there are multiple decision points in the design process.
Other response rates were equivalent across conditions.DiscussionThe present study provides the first evidence from a controlled trial supporting the use of real-time VTC to remotely deliver behavioral parent training to the home setting.",0.001100556070435588
1,"Notably, social distancing guidelines, including guidance to wear face coverings, disinfectant procedures, and general fear among both clients and providers, present significant barriers to care from practical, economic, health, and personal comfort perspectives.
Furthermore, while public Internet access is nearly ubiquitous today, the Pew Research Center reported 75% of U.S. adults also have broadband Internet service at home, suggesting fast, reliable, and more secure connectivity that provides a unique opportunity to leverage telepsychology to address mental health needs.Telepsychology is defined as “the provision of psychological services using telecommunication technologies… [including, but not limited] to telephone, mobile devices, interactive videoconferencing, email, chat, text, and Internet”.
Additionally, telepsychology via videoconferencing and via telephone is associated with strong therapeutic alliances and increased cost-effectiveness, lowering costs by 10% per patient and 16% per visit compared to face-to-face treatment.While use of telepsychology methods increased over recent years in both community and federal agencies such as the Veterans Health Administration, university training clinics largely refrained from shifting to telepsychology with only a limited number of graduate training programs incorporating telepsychology into their curricula prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Furthermore, such guidance may be additionally useful to clinics facing future local or national crises.As the student leaders of our university’s scientist-practitioner training clinic, we recognize our challenges are likely not unique and wish to share recommendations to assist other programs with increasing trainee and supervisory competence in telepsychology during this unprecedented time.
Increasing competency in telepsychology for all clinicians is important for addressing barriers to care and reaching high-risk, high-need populations unable to access in-person therapeutic services.Telepsychology platform considerations should also address routine operations and ensure accessibility for the community the clinic serves, especially those that are low-resourced.
Additional resources on telepsychology platforms and other logistical concerns are available through the Telebehavioral Health Institute, the Telehealth Certification Institute, and the American Telemedicine Association.Develop Ethical and Legal LanguageWe encourage departments to read and discuss the eight telepsychology guidelines developed by the APA Task Force and revise clinic policies and procedures accordingly.
Clinic personnel may also find it helpful to collaborate with information technology personnel to address any technological difficulties as they arise, such as maintaining privacy over video servers.Develop Training ContentDepartments may consider providing an additional course on telepsychology or plan to revise existing course syllabi to include new material related to telepsychology.
We encourage training clinics to identify their respective clinic’s resources and treatment abilities and to refer clients to other agencies if needed.PsychotherapyWhile a growing literature base supports the use of evidence based therapies in telepsychology practice, clinics may wish to be more explicit with students and supervisors regarding what adaptations might be necessary for their specific clinics.
Finally, trainees and supervisors may find benefit from specific training sessions focused on psychotherapy adaptation, as well as specific training sessions focused on helping student psychotherapists manage their own uncertainties during this time in order for trainees to improve their therapeutic presence.SupervisionFinally, clinics should consider holding a supervision-specific training session to provide clarity with expectations and an opportunity to develop supervision contracts at the outset of telepsychology services.
Clinics should also consider the pros and cons of both in-person and telesupervision sessions and discuss these with students and supervisors as research suggests trainees perceive equivalent benefits from either modality.Proposed Telepsychology Curriculum: Four-Session Workshop PrimerDrawing on the general considerations for the transition to telepsychology and core curricula topics, we propose an intensive four-session workshop to facilitate the development of comfort, confidence, and competence with telepsychology prior to initiating services with clients.TABLES AND FIGUREStable/figure thumbnailTable 1.
While the transition to telepsychology may have occurred rapidly for many psychotherapists owing to the COVID-19 pandemic, we encourage students to use this transition as an opportunity for learning and telepsychology competency-building, while enhancing their skills in working adaptively and flexibly to meet client needs and those of the broader community.Overall, we recognize the numerous challenges university training clinics are faced with in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including a need for transitioning from in-person modalities to telepsychology.
However, in recognition that health care professionals who would ordinarily be subject to the HIPAA Security Rule may, during this national emergency, provide telehealth services through remote communications technologies that “may not fully comply with the requirements of the HIPAA Rule,” the OCR issued a Notification of Enforcement Discretion for Telehealth Remote Communications During the COVID-19 Nationwide Public Health Emergency that effectively waives penalties for noncompliance with the HIPAA Security Rule “in connection with the good-faith provision of telehealth using such nonpublic facing1 audio or video communication products during the COVID-19 nationwide public health emergency.” The OCR noted that “[t]his exercise of discretion applies to telehealth provided for any reason, regardless of whether the telehealth service is related to the diagnosis and treatment of health conditions related to COVID-19.” Some state licensing boards also have suspended or relaxed regulations prohibiting interjurisdictional telehealth practice by psychologists not licensed or registered in the state in which the patient or examinee resides, although other boards have not.
The Joint Task Force Guidelines for the Practice of Telepsychology indicate that psychologists may consider the use of a trained assistant to be on premise at the remote location in an effort to help verify the identity of the client/patient, provide needed on-site support to administer certain tests or subtests, and protect the security of the psychological testing and/or assessment process.If feasible, the availability of an on-site proctor who can carry out the tasks just described would best meet the need for supervised MMPI administration.
Indeed, notwithstanding the HHS notification of the OCR’s discretionary waiver of enforcement action, it is important to note that the waiver applies only “in connection with the good faith provision of telehealth using such nonpublic facing audio or video communication products during the COVID-19 nationwide public health emergency.” This implies that practitioners are expected to put forth a good-faith effort to provide telehealth services that conform to HIPAA requirements while waiving penalties for the use of technology that may unknowingly or unwittingly fall short.An APA practice advisory, FAQs Practicing Psychologists Have About COVID-19, includes a response to the question, “What is the effect of HHS waiving HIPAA fines?” The advisory points out that “the notice is vague about what other HIPAA provisions related to telehealth HHS will not enforce.
Remote administration of the MMPI instruments requires that the examiner combine use of Q-global to administer the test with a HIPAA-compliant telehealth service such as those that were just described.Ensure That the Proctor Is Able to Observe the Test Taker Before Providing Access to the TestOne of the security features of Pearson’s Q-global ROSA web-based application—instructions for which are available on its website3—is that a test administrator first creates a record for an examinee and then assigns one or more specific assessments.
Confirmation that the testing environment is private, conducive to testing, unaided by a third party, and secure may also be facilitated by an environment check at the start of the test session, in which the proctor asks the examinee to temporarily reposition the webcam to display the surrounding area.Document the Use of Remote Test Administration and Telehealth Proctoring Both in Your Informed Consent Procedures and in Any Written Report, and Obtain All Necessary Consent for Remote Test Administration and ProctoringIn addition to the obligation all psychologists have for obtaining and documenting informed consent when providing professional services, state law may also impose specific requirements when engaged in telehealth.
Several published papers have provided descriptions of the stages of implementing telepsychology in U.S. university training clinics; however, the present paper aims to build upon this existing literature by providing an overview of the factors and decisions North American doctoral-level psychology training clinics navigated related to the widespread and rapid transition from in-person clinical training and supervision to telepsychology and telesupervision during the COVID-19 pandemic.Similar to the missions of teaching hospitals and academic medical centers, the mission of many doctoral-level psychology training clinics includes training the next generation of psychologists, providing client care, and conducting clinical research.
The aims of this paper are threefold: to present findings from a survey of North American training clinic directors from the Association of Psychology Training Clinics related to the transition to telepsychology; to review considerations for and implications related to the transition to telepsychology on training clinics’ three objectives of training students, providing client care, and conducting clinical research; and to delineate recommendations for clinic reopening and potential future closures as the pandemic continues.The Need for Rapid Telepsychology Implementation in Training ClinicsIn response to the physical distancing directives of the COVID-19 pandemic, training clinic directors were faced with making unprecedented decisions for their training sites.
Of sites that indicated they were implementing, planned to implement, or were considering implementing telepsychology services, 80% reported they were offering or planned to allow trainees to conduct telepsychology from home.Given the swiftness with which sites were required to enact contingency plans and the rapidly changing nature of the global health crisis, the responses to the initial survey may not be reflective of the longer-term actions North American training clinics will make to adapt to extended physical distancing measures.
For clinics that elected to transition to telepsychology, there are numerous training-related factors that should be considered, including providing clear communication and rationale for procedures that differ from best practices, legal and ethical considerations, and practical issues such as adapting to telesupervision and managing trainee and supervisor distress.Closing a clinic versus rapidly switching to telepsychologyAs many North American university training clinics were closed to clients and often staff due to the pandemic, conducting business as usual was no longer an option, and many clinics were forced to decide whether to close entirely or transition swiftly to telepsychology.
Institutional policies that require an often lengthy approval process for any software or technology may significantly interfere with clinics’ ability to access secure videoconferencing platforms and records storage.As survey results indicated, many clinics quickly switched to telepsychology services during the pandemic, and trends from optional survey comments revealed that specific challenges depended on factors like clinic size and preexisting technology.
Clinics that remained open could continue to meet training and client care needs, but faced the challenges of preparing staff, supervisors, and students to engage in telepsychology, logistics of protecting session privacy and security, and ensuring appropriate supervision.
These guidelines have changed in some jurisdictions as a result of the pandemic and should be reviewed by supervisors prior to incorporating these telepsychology practices into training clinics.It is also important for supervisors to consider and monitor the physical location of the trainees who are delivering telepsychology and the clients who are receiving services to ensure that the services provided are in compliance with regulations regarding practice within one’s jurisdiction.
In cases in which a training clinic is located near a jurisdiction’s border, it is recommended that training clinics consult with their university’s legal counsel to establish a written plan for continuity of care for clients or trainees located in other jurisdictions.Ethical considerationsSeveral ethical issues related to training need to be carefully considered when trainees deliver telepsychology, including building competence in telepsychology as well as maintaining documentation and recording sessions.CompetenceAt the most basic level, anyone providing telepsychology must demonstrate competence to do so.
As North American university training clinics have transitioned from in-person services to telepsychology, they have generally required that clinical supervisors and trainees carefully review best practice guidelines and participate in a web-based training before being allowed to practice telepsychology.Maintaining documentation and recording sessionsSeveral privacy considerations are unique to training clinics when rapidly converting training clinics into telepsychology providers, particularly related to maintaining records and recording sessions.
Strategies supervisors can use to minimize trainees’ distress include being available for consultation, presenting clear guidelines for delivering telepsychology, developing opportunities for virtual check-ins and support, and providing resources for additional basic needs, including financial, food, housing, and self-care resources.
Although it is best to provide continuity of care for assessment clients, supervisors should discuss with trainees the importance of maintaining fidelity to standardized test administration to the extent possible, while also flexibly administering or substituting subtests when necessary and adhering to copyright laws.Additionally, some training clinics have used flexibility in how they provide teleassessment services.
A recent analysis of nationally representative data from the United States determined that 94% of children aged 3 to 18 had access to a computer at home and 61% had both a computer and Internet access; therefore, phone sessions with parents, older children, and adolescents may be the only feasible option in some cases both within the United States and in countries with less access to technology.While the research base is small, there is evidence that individual cognitive and behavioral treatments, medication management, and group interventions can be effectively delivered to youth using telepsychology.
Supervisors should assist trainees in remaining open to the unique experiences of their older adult clients, including the ways in which they may demonstrate a more measured response and optimistic perspective around the risks of COVID-19 than middle-aged and young adults.RefugeesNumerous cultural barriers to mental health services for ethnic and racial minorities exist and extend to the provision of telepsychology services for refugees during COVID-19.
Children who access services in a US-based training clinic who are familiar with technology, fluent in English, and integrated in the U.S. school system appear to benefit from telepsychology similarly to nonrefugee clients, although research is needed to support this claim.Conducting ResearchIn addition to their primary functions of providing clinical services and student training opportunities, many psychology training clinics participate in clinical research.
Clear articulation of the relative balance of risk to clients and staff of staying open, access to appropriate health protections, and available options for maintaining client care and student training can be helpful in discussing closure with local administrators.In many cases, however, the decision to reclose during a pandemic resurgence will not rest with a clinic director but rather will be made at the institutional or governmental level.
New clients should also be given the option to consent to telepsychology at intake, even if it is not immediately applicable, and having clinicians use a small period of in-person session time to ensure that clients know how to access the relevant videoconferencing platform, follow links to online assessment measures, and contact their clinician in case of schedule changes or other between-session needs is recommended.
Providing resources to assist financially disadvantaged clients secure free or low-cost Internet access and a smartphone or computer may be particularly beneficial in the event of rapid closure.DiscussionIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, results from the both APTC surveys suggest that the majority of doctoral level psychology training clinics in North America rapidly transitioned to providing services exclusively via telepsychology and that clinic-based research was largely able to continue, albeit with some modifications.
Overall, although the results of the first APTC survey were preliminary, the combined results of both surveys indicate that psychology training clinics in North America responded quickly to directives for physical distancing by largely transitioning to telepsychology services to ensure that training, supervision, and client care could continue.It is challenging to identify the best ways to approach training in a novel and rapidly changing situation like the COVID-19 pandemic.
The CCTC guidelines, followed by similar guidelines from APPIC, include four principles relevant to the decisions that training programs, sites, and supervisors may need to make regarding whether, when, and how to transition from in-person services to telepsychology.First, decisions must balance many — sometimes competing — considerations, responsibilities, and roles.
Trainers and supervisors hold the power and responsibility to advocate for trainee and client needs.As the COVID-19 pandemic led training clinics to rapidly develop the infrastructure for telepsychology practice, several issues are critical for the field to address.
Training clinics will need to consider whether and in what contexts to continue offering telepsychology services once the current global health crisis dissipates, and care will need to be taken to ensure that any policies and procedures that were adopted during the pandemic in response to relaxed legal guidelines are adapted to reflect the reinstated laws.
Advances in telecommunications have expanded the practice of telepsychology to include providing psychological services using devices and activities such as interactive videoconferencing, e-mail, chat, and text, not to mention Internet use with blogs, self-help websites, and social media.
Common uses of telepsychology to augment in-person sessions include telephone sessions to check on progress or to deal with an urgent matter, e-mailing supplemental information or links to resources, texting appointment information; using mental health apps for monitoring or tracking behaviors, and having clients complete online testing or assessment instruments.Risk Management Tip: Psychologists must attend to the privacy and security of communication methods—for example, using secure e-mail for sending Protected Health Information, encryption for cell phones, and informing clients of the risks.Security measures evolve as threats and breaches of protection occur—a highly recommended product or service may quickly become no longer secure.
It is incumbent on those practitioners who are considering adding telepsychology to their practices to understand its potential for providing needed, quality services; what knowledge, tools, competencies, preparation, and ongoing training are essential; the guidelines and regulations that govern the legal and ethical practice of telepsychology; and risks and risk management strategies.Risk Management Tip: Psychologists must seek out appropriate training experiences to develop and maintain competence in delivering telepsychology services.Ongoing training experiences in areas of clinical, technical, emotional, and cultural competence can be obtained through webinars, workshops, research reviews, and consultation.
Because this is a developing modality of practice, remaining current about developments in technology; ethical, business, and regulatory issues; clinical outcome studies; and factors that impact delivery of services is essential.Why Is This a Growth Area?Individuals seeking psychological services have faced barriers that have often prevented access, resulting in failure to receive needed mental health care.
Telephone communication has, of course, been an integral part of psychological practice for many years, but the advent of inexpensive videoconferencing capability makes real-time, synchronous telepsychology available for most individuals.Risk Management Tip: Make a determination about using telepsychology primarily based on appropriateness for the individual client.Once you have decided on using telepsychology with a client, document what variables you considered; your thought process, including how you will continue to assess the appropriateness of this modality; and your client’s response.Clearly, telepsychology can overcome many barriers and increase access to needed services.
For example, it allows us to treat someone in rural areas where traveling to treatment centers may be too cumbersome or to continue treating clients who are transferred for extended periods to another state due to work.State policies typically address how you can provide telepsychology within the state; however, clinicians must be aware that each state has its own set of laws and regulations about how it permits psychologists from outside its jurisdiction to treat its residents.
For more information, resources, and ongoing developments about PSYPACT, please go to PSYPACT.org.What Do I Need to Know?There are many opportunities for psychologists to use telepsychology as a primary method of providing services or as a supplement to benefit clients, and as with in-person provision of services, there are many responsibilities—some similar and some different.
The guidelines, which were approved in July 2013, are intended both to educate and to inform psychologists in their practice in applying current standards of professional practice when using telecommunication technologies in providing psychological services.Telepsychology is not a specialty but rather is a modality that extends in-person standards of practice to telecommunication.
Particularly important is an assessment of the “medical conditions, mental status, and stability, psychiatric diagnosis, current or historic use of substances, treatment history, and therapeutic needs that may be relevant”.Risk Management Tip: Conduct a conservative assessment of a client’s diagnosis, history, and risk level and determine that these factors do not contraindicate providing services via telepsychology.Seek risk management resources, including consultation, which identify high-risk populations and other factors that may interfere with effective use of telepsychology.The most desirable condition for telepsychology is for the client to be physically located at a facility in which the requirements for privacy, confidential exchanges, and absence from distractions are ensured.
Monitoring of these conditions is an ongoing process, not an initial assessment only.Informed ConsentThe APA Ethics Code identifies the key elements of informed consent that are necessary elements of professional practice in psychology.Risk Management Tip: Clinicians should thoroughly inform clients of what they may expect in terms of services offered, unavailable services, access to the practitioner, emergency coverage, and similar issues.Psychologists are encouraged to review available resources, including sample informed consent documents, and make a checklist of important areas to cover.
These variations should be determined in advance of services, agreed upon by clients, and prominent in the informed consent.Risk Management Tip: If third parties are billed for services offered via electronic means, practitioners must clearly indicate that fact on billing forms.Billing codes are standardized, so psychologists are encouraged to consult with colleagues and their professional association to ensure knowledge of and access to current codes, keeping in mind they may change over time.(d) Engagement in initiating, maintaining, and responding to telecommunications by clients is much more extensive than in in-person service.
Have I made these risks clear to the patients/clients/consultees so that they are able to make an informed decision about initiating or continuing with services?Does my informed consent include information about my privacy, security, and data storage, transmission, and disposal policies?Did I establish a fee schedule related to telecommunications-based services that specifies issues related to technology disruptions?Was I knowledgeable about emergency, professional, and consultative local resources for the person I plan to serve remotely?At the outset of a remote service, did I obtain a contact number for my client in case of technological failure or clinical emergency?ConfidentialityDiscovery of in-person service clinical notes or session content is only at risk for a court subpoena.
The statement should inform clients of the standard limitations, any state-specific requirements, and cautions about privacy problems with broadcast conversations.The threats to confidentiality include therapist/client misdirection of content, technology failures, use of social media, and in-person viewing of electronic messages by others in the therapist or client space.Risk Management Tip: Follow basic security protocols to ensure that sensitive patient data are never placed at unnecessary risk: Password protect the device, secure the devices when not in use, and limit use of devices to professional activities.No e-mail message is truly and irrevocably deleted.
Psychologists acquire additional training and consultation in utilization encryption, robust passwords, and backup systems as essential means of securing confidential data.Risk Management Tip: Seek frequent consultation from knowledgeable legal, computer and server IT, and malpractice experts.Electronic data are applicable to the APA Recordkeeping Guidelines in that types of data, length of retention, and treatment of data standards for in-person records should be met.
The following are considerations when deciding to implement telepsychology with specific clients and their particular presenting problems:Use of telepsychology services should be deemed at least as effective as face-to-face services and should be determined by evidence-based findings regarding client variables and application of the techniques or theoretical approaches employed.Review available literature to support the use of telepsychology with each client’s specific diagnosis.The psychologist should review current laws, state and national, as well as regulatory rules in order to ensure that the psychologist is engaged in appropriate and legal practice.Make a determination of technology use primarily based upon appropriateness for the individual client.Develop a plan for using telepsychology and technology with clients that outlines the rationale and process.
Discuss the reason for introducing the telepsychology component with the client and obtain informed consent.Discuss and address new issues of confidentiality and security that arise with the introduction of the telepsychology component in therapy, including securing the area where the patient will be during the telepsychology sessions.Practice using the equipment and software to ensure the patient is comfortable and capable of engaging in telepsychology.Conduct ongoing monitoring to ensure that telepsychology continues to meet the intended therapeutic purpose.Technology competence should be assured both for the psychologist and the client.
When evaluating the progress of a client, the psychologist should also evaluate the use of technology.Join or create an ongoing, standing group of other psychologists who use technology in their work to provide continual consultation and support.Conduct periodic assessment of the clinical utility of the technology being used to determine whether to continue its use.Psychologists who decide to incorporate telepsychology into their practices will be able to answer these questions confidently and completely:How much do I know about the clinical research/professional literature, including guidelines, on using telepsychology?
Specifically, what are the benefits and what are the risks?How will I monitor and ensure appropriateness of treatment, technological competence, confidentiality and security, knowledge of emergency resources, and continued learning?How will I identify and manage risk?Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act/Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health ActIn addition to state and jurisdictional requirements, psychologists must ensure compliance with federal requirements.
Psychologists need a business associate agreement with any third party that may have access to patients’ data.Risk Management Tip: Thoroughly review and consult to learn what you do not know, what you need to know, and what you need to access, and then develop a plan of action before disposing of data and devices.They also need policies and procedures in place to securely store, transfer, and dispose of patient data and should use HIPAA-compliant vendors and encryption, when possible.Hardware Disposal PlanDelete all files from the laptop computer.Reformat computer hard drive and USB drives.Complete “factory reset” or “hard reset” for mobile device and tablet.Ensure that no patient information remains on encrypted external storage devices by deleting files and reformatting the drive.Recycle hardware with a local technology recycling company or with a vendor offering a rebate.Software Removal/Disposal PlanDelete all contacts and call history from text, e-mail, and videoconferencing programs.Uninstall software/mobile applications from all hardware.Log in to any web-based interfaces to delete any stored information.Contact the vendors for web-based services to inquire how to ensure that all deleted information was permanently deleted from any future access.Staying Informed/Staying CurrentPsychologists are very familiar with their responsibility to be competent as professionals, and when practicing telepsychology, technical competence is added to intellectual and emotional competence.
They should remember to include professional groups that focus on telemetry and consult with their professional liability provider for risk management guidance, workshops, and other resources.The ever-changing world of technology and of the standard of care for using telepsychology in therapy and assessment requires vigilance on the part of the practitioner.
The Guidelines include Competence of the Psychologist, Standards of Care in the Delivery of Telepsychology Services, Informed Consent, Confidentiality of Data and Information, Security and Transmission of Data and Information, Disposal of Data and Information and Technologies, Testing and Assessment, and Interjurisdictional Practice.Ethical Principles of Psychologists and Code of Conduct, https://www.apa.org/ethics/code/ethics-code-2017.pdf: The Ethics Code identifies standards and rules of conduct that apply to psychologists in their professional roles.
Remember, too, that laws change, so frequent review of state regulations is strongly suggested.ASPPB, https://www.asppb.net: With its mission “To support member jurisdictions in fulfilling their responsibility of public protection” and a vision of “Consistent standards that ensure the competent practice of psychology,” ASPPB created PSYPACT, an interstate compact, “to facilitate telehealth and temporary in-person, face-to-face practice of psychology across jurisdictional boundaries.” ASPPB provides important and updated information on PSYPACT legislation, rules, and implementation in addition to a database of current licensing requirements through its PSY/Book, formerly known as the ASPPB Handbook on Licensing and Certification Requirements.The Trust: The Trust remains a leading provider of insurance and risk management programs for psychologists, psychology students, and related individuals in the United States.
In addition, the workshops and consultation that The Trust offers through its risk management program provide psychologists with important guidance to help them reduce their risk in the area of telepsychology.Another valuable resource is the American Telemedicine Association, which provides training materials and opportunities, discussion forums, updates in the field of telehealth, and information on current telehealth initiatives.There are many additional resources to consult.
These advancements in technology protect people’s data from unintended breaches and mishandling, while also potentially keeping out those with a legal responsibility to help clients transition if their provider were to unexpectedly depart.Ethical ConsiderationsAPA’s Ethics Code serves as a foundational text for mental health providers’ ethical decision-making; containing, both principles and standards in the text, with the former informing the latter.
However, when writing a professional will we recommend that mental health providers consider the possibility of a potential unexpected departure and the related risks such a scenario creates.To help mitigate these concerns, mental health providers should name a data custodian to receive appropriate PHI and access privileges; ideally, this individual would be a person who is ethical, trustworthy, competent, and familiar with the mandates associated with managing confidential patient data.
By sharing vital passwords for login, providers can assist clients via a custodian to access records and continue care elsewhere.Secure Professional Liability/Malpractice InsuranceFor many providers, professional liability coverage from insurers like The Trust or the American Professional Agency serves as a necessary component of providing high-quality, ethical mental health care by helping to effectively manage practice risks.
Importantly, all licensed providers, nonlicensed practitioners, and student trainees who treat clients or patients should carefully consider their individual circumstances and secure a professional liability plan suited to their personal needs and preferences.ConclusionsAdvancements in record keeping and other technologies directly and indirectly used for the provision of mental health care services have empowered clinicians to consider more cost-effective and efficient services.
To better protect clients and practices, we recommend providers select a competent custodian for records, place policies within informed consent documentation, examine retention policies of third-party companies, create a professional will, utilize end-of-life features, maintain awareness of both ethical and legal obligations, and to secure malpractice insurance.
On the other hand, if clients in these states are not under the care of a behavioral health professional or in some cases, a licensed health professional, IGSH remote services may be delivered to them with no oversight or stipulations in place.In addition to defining the scope of practice for guides, including specific task and role boundaries, IGSH programs must determine the appropriate backgrounds and credentials for those providing guidance.
The telehealth community would benefit if researchers agreed to share a higher level of detail in describing IGSH programs, such as specifics about guidance provided, supervisory structure, and risk management procedures in place, such that clinicians and technology innovators can learn from these and use data to develop best practices.
Thus, VAPIHCS is in a unique position to provide valuable information on the usefulness of telesupervision to VAPIHCS training programs and perhaps to the rest of the VA and other groups considering this method of supervision to trainees.The current EBP project sought to assess any differences in VAPIHCS psychology trainees’ satisfaction and working alliance perceptions of telesupervision to that of the current usual and standard practice of clinical supervision delivered in person.",0.001683501683501683
2,"Not surprisingly then, one of the largest and most sustained effects of the COVID-19 pandemic is its impact on mental health and, by extension, the prosperity of nations worldwide.Due to the financial, social, and psychological stress of COVID-19, and the reduction in supports attributed to physical distancing requirements, it is expected that anxiety, depression, and traumatic stress will increase dramatically as a function of COVID-19.
Telemental health may also be effective in reducing common barriers to accessing treatment, such as transportation to treatment sessions, increasing access to evidence-based services in rural areas or in communities without specialized mental health services in Canada, and in low- and middle-income countries with low funding for in person services.Importantly, although there are myriad benefits to telemental health, there are also notable limitations, and these should be weighed prior to the widespread adoption of telemental health practices with all clients during and beyond COVID-19.
Without alternatives or shifts in care delivery models, such as telemental health, many individuals would be left without access to needed treatment.Third, many mental health programs have long waitlists, especially for individuals who are seeking treatment and unable to wait for the resolution of the pandemic to receive services.
In sum, telemental health is not a panacea and requires careful consideration for appropriateness depending on client needs and standards for ensuring client confidentiality and security.Considerations for Children and YouthIn an effort to curb the spread of COVID-19, significant changes to youth’s daily activities and operations have been imposed, including school closures, required social distancing from peers and other supports, loss of athletics and other organized activities that are frequently sources of strength and support, loss of resources, home confinement, and potential increased family stress.
Thus, there is likely to be an influx of need for mental health services in children and youth.As noted above, telemental health has several benefits, including increased reach and accessibility for children living in rural areas, reduced treatment attrition, and cost savings for parents due to reduced travel cost and time off work.
Youth with attentional difficulties, severe mental illness and/or high levels of emotion dysregulation or family conflict may struggle to engage over telemental health platforms, and, if possible, in-person support may need to be prioritized for these clients during COVID-19.
Finally, although telemental health has the benefit of providing the therapist with a window into the child’s home environment that would not be available with in-person care, the narrow “lens” of the telemental health camera may limit assessment of interpersonal interactions, family dynamics, and precludes detection of softly spoken but potentially clinically important parallel conversations.Considerations for CliniciansPrior to COVID-19, the implementation and uptake of telemental health services within the public and private sector was slow.
Consistent with Principle II: Responsible Caring from the Canadian Code of Ethics, clinicians and their agencies will have to determine how to provide high-quality services for a large body of Canadians in need, while ensuring caseloads remain manageable for clinicians.Concerns in regard to the ethical delivery of telemental health have been a particular focus for clinicians during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Relatedly, some authors have determined that although COVID-19 poses distinct challenges to psychology doctoral trainees, the pandemic also serves as a rare training opportunity to build additional ethical and clinical competencies.Considerations for SystemsOn May 3, 2020, the federal government committed to invest $240M in telehealth services to respond to the influx of Canadians in need of virtual medical care due to COVID-19.
Moreover, given that one of the central barriers to practitioners using telemental health is technology-specific, policy resources could be allocated to online training modules to increase practitioners’ computer literacy for telemental health platforms, so that access to care could be expanded.As we are on the precipice of a wave of increased and likely sustained mental health needs due to COVID-19, clinicians and organizations that provide mental health care need to prepare to meet the incoming demand, while also balancing physical distancing rules, client and clinician safety, and confidentiality.
When feasible, hybrid models could be explored, wherein in-person care is utilized for building rapport, establishing therapeutic alliance, ensuring confidence in diagnostic formulation, and treatment planning, followed by telemental health sessions for ongoing monitoring and treatment.Although many of these treatment configurations are being implemented to meet the rapidly evolving mental health needs of Canadians due to COVID-19, research evaluations of these modalities and therapeutic formations are needed.
COVID-19 is forcing us to upgrade and rethink the technologies of our practice, but it also provides an opportunity to update and rethink many of the other tools we use.Global ReachAs I previously noted, JPI is a truly international journal with an extensive reach across every region impacted by the pandemic, including those locations where psychotherapists are faced with limited access to evidence-based resources.
Alongside the impact on hospital and physical health care, the fast spread of COVID-19 has placed significant strains on providing mental health services by negatively impacting the capacity, availability, responsiveness, and resilience of public and private health care systems worldwide.There is emerging evidence of the psychological impact of COVID-19 on populations, both directly because of the distress accompanying confirmed cases in individuals and their loved ones and indirectly because of population health policy and interventions such as quarantine.
Against a preexisting backdrop of increasingly stretched mental health services in developed and developing countries, the direct and indirect psychosocial effects of COVID-19 present an urgent challenge for mental health research, practice, and policy.In this context, increasing access to psychological therapies through technologically informed approaches presents an opportunity to adapt to the mental health care delivery challenges posed by COVID-19 while also supporting client choice around mode and flexibility of delivery.
As with previous crises, mental health emergency response includes in the early stages an active collaboration between clinical psychologists, psychotherapists, and psychological intervention specialists with the rest of the multiprofessional health care system in the treatment of the immediate impacts of COVID-19 presentations.
As an example, in acute health settings, interventions such as psychological debriefing, critical incident stress debriefing, or other single session intervention that mandate staff to talk about mental health responses are to be avoided, although compassionate and sensitive awareness of the impact of critical care on health care professionals remains a powerful and important principle.Mental Health of COVID-19 Patients and Their RelativesSecond, addressing psychological distress among infected individuals and their relatives requires special attention.
In this sense, Rosen, Glassman, and Morland’s paper provides a roadmap toward how clinicians can use telepsychotherapy technologies for providing strengths-based preventive interventions for coping with distress during periods of disruption, life threat, and loss and for delivery of effective treatments to people who develop chronic conditions in response to traumatic stress.Adaptations of Psychological Interventions for Existing Mental Health PresentationsThird, when adapting psychotherapy delivery to a telepsychotherapy format for people with preexisting psychiatric disorders, continuity of care and continuity of therapeutic experience is highly important.
Because the impact of the pandemic is expected to be manifested across different life domains, mental health professionals might need to collaborate with other professionals such as occupational counselors to address the need to find a new job for their clients.Current and Emerging Challenges From the PandemicIn organizing psychological assistance within and across various stages of the pandemic, we highlight four major challenges:First, health care systems include deficits in material, and human resources carry risk of rendering them less responsive to psychological aspects of the pandemic.
There are a number of groups that may benefit from telepsychotherapy including health care workers engaged in frontline response to the pandemic and their patients; individuals with new mental health distress as a function of COVID-19 diagnosis, or losing family and loved ones to the illness, or the psychological effects of prolonged physical distancing; and individuals with existing mental health conditions.
The needs/preferences survey was undertaken to help shape telehealth services for this population particularly those residing in rural/geographically isolated areas as well as those who are not physically well enough to attend clinic-based appointments.As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the use of telehealth services for clinical care has dramatically risen for a variety of reasons.
Social isolation has been associated with a reduced capacity to perform activities of daily living, depression, a compromised immune system, cardiovascular disease, and mortality.In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, clinicians should consider that while social distancing measures may mediate exponential contagion in a population, they may also have the unintended effect of exacerbating social isolation and loneliness, key social determinants of health among persons with CLRD and their informal caregivers.
There is evidence that most clinical interventions for this population do not have an educational component despite the potentially positive impact on care.Overview of Telehealth ServicesTelehealth is a broad term to describe the use of technology to remotely provide health care services and can be used by clinicians from various disciplines to assist persons with CLRD and their informal caregivers.
They were asked if they would benefit from telehealth services which could potentially provide an additional layer of health education and emotional support in addition to what they were already receiving during their regularly scheduled clinic appointments, what their needs/treatment preferences were for the structure and content of these services, and what they perceived as barriers for participating.
Therefore, clinician-supported interpretation and discussion of health-related information may be a necessary form of support when working with this population.Assess level of comprehension of the health care information and identify what stressors or barriers affect the learning process.Account for cultural and religious beliefs, emotional barriers, desire and motivation to learn, cognitive and physical limitations, and barriers to communication.Ascertain relational dynamics within the persons with CLRD’s family including the relationship with their informal caregiver, what support systems are in place, and how their environment impacts their care and learning needs.Practice Flexibility in DeliveryApplying telehealth delivery platforms to support persons with CRLD and their informal caregivers, particularly during a pandemic, requires flexibility and creativity.
In addition to an individualized plan, the American Lung Association and the American Heart Association have recommended action plans that give clear instructions for patients and caregivers to follow should any new signs or symptoms develop.Assess Level of Social Isolation and LonelinessAs documented in the paper, persons living with CLRD and their informal caregivers who experience social isolation and/or loneliness are at high risk in the context of COVID-19 for a significant spectrum of health and emotional issues, many of which impact relationships and communication between patients and families or caregivers.
Based on our research, 7 clinical implications and recommendations were provided for the practice of telehealth with this population: provide patient centered care and health education, practice flexibility in delivery, consider the impact of physical symptoms, conduct a psychosocial assessment, offer stress reduction and relaxation strategies, provide resources for developing an action plan for responding to an acute exacerbation of respiratory symptoms, and know your scope of practice.
Telepsychotherapy, once considered an optional or peripheral practice, has become central to delivering care during this pandemic.Considering this global pandemic, clinicians will need to be flexible in how they deliver services, integrating knowledge from telepsychotherapy, PTSD treatment research, and disaster mental health to inform how they address their patients’ needs during and after the pandemic.
In this article, we draw on these literatures to discuss how mental health professionals can use telepsychotherapy to address two challenges: providing support to help distressed people cope during a period of high stress and social isolation, especially for medical personnel and other individuals with high exposure to pandemic-related illness and death and remotely treating people who have developed significant posttraumatic stress symptoms.The goal of this article is to integrate findings from these literatures to inform psychotherapists’ provision of telepsychotherapy during the current pandemic.
The likely traumatic effects of the global COVID-19 pandemic will require aggressive and innovative changes as mental health care systems across the world adapt to using technology to deliver care.Role of Telepsychotherapy During a PandemicTelepsychotherapy technologies were originally developed to overcome geographic- and time-related barriers to care.
Effective psychotherapies for PTSD, including cognitive processing therapy and prolonged exposure, work as well when delivered via video telepsychotherapy as they do in person.Although research clearly supports the efficacy of CVT, rapid change to virtual care comes with legitimate concerns regarding the potential impact of telepsychotherapy on the psychotherapy process.
Level 2 interventions involve formal treatment for individuals who have substantial stress disorder symptoms, or who develop PTSD, major depressive disorder, insomnia, or an anxiety disorder, and require care from a well-trained mental health care provider.Level 1: Interventions to Reduce Acute Distress and Support CopingLevel 1 interventions encourage positive coping following disasters, at time when people experience dislocation, chaos, and high levels of stress.
There are many online and app-based resources that promote the use of positive coping skills that are easily accessible and widely disseminatable to large groups of individuals during a COVID-19 pandemic, without adding burden to the mental health treatment system.Internet-based interventions based on CBT principles delivered via computer or mobile phone shortly after trauma had significant effects on worry or PTSD symptoms in three trials that targeted individuals with elevated symptoms.
COVID Coach is new app designed to help people cope with feelings of stress and anxiety in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.Level 1 interventions, delivered by either mental health care professionals or trained paraprofessionals, may be useful in promoting positive coping among people who are experiencing acute distress during a period of pandemic-related uncertainty and disruption.
However, when an individual has developed significant mental health symptoms and functional problems that are not resolving on their own, Level 2 interventions are more appropriate.Level 2: Psychotherapy for Acute Stress Disorder and PTSDIn the wake of COVID-19, it is reassuring to have strong data confirming the effectiveness of evidence-based individual and group CVT telepsychotherapy for PTSD and other trauma-related conditions.
Further, these studies speak to the robust nature of our established EBTs for PTSD psychotherapy and the ability to retain clinical efficacy despite patient and provider not being in the same location, such as with COVID-19.Telepsychotherapy for trauma reactions via telephoneWhile the majority of telepsychotherapy research focuses on the use of CVT platforms, there are situations where care must be delivered by telephone.
In short, although the research on phone telepsychotherapy is less developed, it has proven effective for treating depression and remains a viable option when CVT telepsychotherapy is not possible.Clinical Considerations in Delivering Telepsychotherapy for PTSDClinical challenges in adapting to telepsychotherapyMany providers are capable of transitioning to telepsychotherapy, but it requires that clinicians develop some new skills.Maheu and colleagues, recommend seven core telehealth competencies that clinicians must develop in order to competently deliver telepsychotherapy: The ability to evaluate patients’ suitability for telehealth, a ‘telepresence’ in interacting via video, comfort with the technology, knowledge of legal/regulatory issues, evidence-based practice, an ability to integrate mobile health tools, and telepractice development.
Furthermore, integrating telepsychology into rural primary care settings has led to improved mental health outcomes.Despite literature on the effectiveness and utility of telepsychology services, there is limited research on integrating telepsychology within psychology training programs.
Students will need to gain a comprehensive understanding of past, present, and future directions of integrated behavioral health care and the increased rural Latinx diversity in order to meet this burgeoning need.Developing Community PartnershipsThrough established relationships with invested rural community partners and health care professionals, graduate training programs may facilitate clinical practicum partnerships to provide telepsychology services.
The current pandemic may produce more chronic symptoms than most disasters because of its unpredictability, its unknown duration, the lack of cues for differentiating safety from danger, the high level of social and economic disruption, and the high number of fatalities.The need to stem the spread of infection has sharply limited mental health providers’ ability to provide in-person care, precisely at a time when there is an increased need for proactive prevention and treatment.
These telemental health methods, once considered secondary to in-person care, have become critical and central to delivering psychological support to veterans during the pandemic.This article describes how VHA dramatically increased its telemental health services in the opening days of the COVID-19 pandemic by leveraging its existing infrastructure and prior planning.
The final section reviews the ongoing challenges that VHA and other mental health care organizations may need to address when expanding telemental health services during and after this pandemic.Effectiveness of Telemental HealthTelemental Health via VideoA growing body of research, much of it involving veterans, has examined the use of video telemental health to overcome geographic and logistical barriers to care.
Although providers who have never used telemental health may have concerns about offering these services, the COVID-19 pandemic required clinicians to quickly face these fears and shift to a different health care model.VHA Response to COVID-19: Scaling up Remote Services to Maintain Continuity of CareVHA is the nation’s largest integrated health care system, annually caring for over 6 million veterans at 1,286 sites.
To decrease the need for in-person visits, mental health leaders worked closely with providers and program leads to determine what components of care could be delivered virtually, and to determine which essential services could only be delivered on-site.A key concern of VHA during the COVID-19 pandemic was ensuring access to mental health care, especially for patients who were especially vulnerable.
Mental health leaders at the local and national level disseminated materials to support their staff, reiterated available resources to enable virtual care, shared promising practices, encouraged self-care, and set expectations that service delivery might need to be adjusted repeatedly throughout surge and recovery periods of the pandemic.
Mental health leadership also encouraged providers to be adaptable to address needs of all veterans in their caseload.VHA issued national guidance encouraging facilities to contact veterans to offer virtual encounters in place of scheduled appointments, and to reserve in-person visits for urgent care.
Although many phone encounters were likely case management calls or brief check-ins, which are routinely done by phone, psychotherapy was also being provided via telephone during this time.Before the pandemic, VHA policies and trainings emphasized video as the recommended telemental health modality, In the first weeks of the pandemic, to ensure that all veterans could be contacted promptly, VHA directives supported clinicians using telephone as a primary modality.
Reasons for clinicians’ continued reliance on phone after April may include difficulty reeducating veterans and clinicians who started using phone to now shift to prioritize video; limited administrative support for launching telemental health; difficulties preparing less tech-savvy patients to use VVC; some clinicians having difficulty getting comfortable with video care; and lack of good Internet connection access in some communities.VHA’s rapid and successful shift to telemental health services involved significant challenges.
In the early stages of this pandemic, VHA demonstrated great organizational flexibility, maintaining continual two-way communication with mental health leaders and providers during a time of dynamic change, and empowering clinicians to use alternative approaches necessary to ensure that veterans continued to get the right care at the right time.
There was also little information on site-level barriers and facilitators that might explain varying rates of VVC use at different VHA facilities.Even so, VHA’s experience suggests three factors may be especially important in determining the degree to which VHA and other health care systems more fully integrate telemental health into routine clinical care, even after the COVID-19 pandemic has abated.
More research is also needed on models of care that combine different modalities, such as initially providing online or smartphone self-management tools with telephone support and then stepping up to remote psychotherapy if needed.The final factor that will impact the integration of telemental health into routine clinical care is better understanding of patient preferences.
Feedback from these informed consumers can help health care organizations develop more flexible, patient-centered approaches for collaboratively deciding when to provide care in-person, via video, by telephone, or through a combination of formats.The COVID-19 pandemic has forced health care organizations, clinicians, and consumers to rapidly shift to increasing their use of telemental health.
As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve, many Veterans Healthcare Administration mental health providers are concerned with if they can and whether they should continue to deliver trauma-focused care during this current crisis.Because of the VHA’s capacity to offer telemental health services, veterans have the opportunity to continue engaging in trauma-focused treatments remotely using Veterans Affairs Video Connect, the VHA’s secure video telehealth platform, which allows providers to treat veterans on their mobile devices or personal computers.
Given its comprehensive nature, one of the major goals of TMH is to reduce disparities in access to high-quality, evidence-based, mental health care, making TMH particularly well-suited to address the dearth of specialized mental health resources in rural areas.TMH in Veteran’s Health AdministrationThere is an increasing demand to address Veterans’ mental health needs, and the current body of literature highlights the mismatch between the proportion of Veterans residing in rural areas and qualified mental health providers who are available to provide services, Office of Rural Health, 2015).
Increasing evidence suggests that Veterans can be treated for a wide range of diagnoses via TMH, with efficacy and satisfaction comparable to that of in-person treatment, for individual and group therapy, as well as neuropsychological testing.The VHA TMH Hub initiative was developed in 2002, with the aim of using technology-facilitated care, to provide patient-centered, expedient mental health services from a facility “hub” to “spoke” site facilities, residential treatment centers, student health centers and Veterans’ homes; Godleski, 2014).
In addition, obstacles to disseminating information and educating patients about TMH have been raised as potential challenges to implementation in large, private health care systems.Nevertheless, evidence of factors facilitating TMH implementation include, increasing communication about treatment offerings to referring providers and identifying staff that support telehealth at each level of the organization.
Another study evaluating use of TMH with female Veterans identified driving forces in the expansion of TMH to be efforts to reduce stigma in receiving mental health services, particularly in small communities where maintaining anonymity is challenging; opportunities to work with clinicians with specialized training; and ease of receiving services in one’s home.As TMH services and technology advances, it is increasingly important to understand the unique barriers and facilitators in the implementation of TMH within VA.
Strategies are offered to improve telehealth processes, enhance effectiveness of mental health care for Veterans and support evolution, to flexibly meet the needs of Veterans and continually improve services, which benefits TMH clinical providers, technical staff, hospital leadership and administration.MethodThe information presented here was generated through discussion among nine psychologists working in the TMH Hub, during weekly staff and peer supervision meetings, over the first two years of implementing TMH services.
However, given the short-term model of evidence-based treatments, connecting Veterans in need of additional services following telehealth treatment poses difficulties, due to the complexity of Veterans’ presenting issues and the lack of specialized clinical resources in spoke site areas.
It can be difficult to coordinate care with other providers across sites, which impacts access to important information about Veterans that may be more readily available with on-site multidisciplinary communication.Provision of clinical servicesTelehealth treatment provides unique opportunities in clinical assessment and delivery of psychotherapy, as well as the ability to reduce wait times for initial appointments and improve overall access to quality mental health care.
In addition, for telehealth clinic appointments, Hub psychologists rely on technical staff to transmit materials and the reliability and speed with which materials are received by Hub psychologists is significantly impacted by the staff member’s availability.Administrative IssuesLastly, administrative issues are discussed in the areas of overall logistical processes and the development of the Hub structure, the “network model” and integrating VA NYH TMH Hub’s missions.Procedures and logisticsSince implementation of the VA NYH TMH Hub, a range of administrative barriers have been addressed to facilitate delivery of services offered through the Hub. When the Hub was created, unique challenges to offering telehealth services were present, such as a lack of regulatory clarity on psychologists’ ability to practice across state lines, the need to develop and implement a mission statement, as well as the need to tailor various policies and procedures to meet the requirements of the spoke sites in the absence of national TMH standards.
The VA NYH TMH Hub’s mission is threefold: provide high-quality, short-term, evidence-based clinical care to rural Veterans, evaluate the effectiveness of TMH and ability to successfully treat complex presenting issues through ongoing research and quality improvement; train psychology graduate students at various levels of training in the provision of TMH services.
The combination of the use of V2H visits and standardized scheduling procedures has improved the efficiency of the scheduling process and decreased the administrative burden on Hub providers, thus facilitating increased availability for high quality, direct patient care.DiscussionAs TMH services grow within VA and other community mental health settings, pragmatic support regarding program development will continue to inform effective implementation and expansion for clinicians, technical and leadership staff.
Although integration into multidisciplinary teams and procedural variations across sites was noted to be challenging, the model of organization supports access to a range of specialized, evidence-based therapies and assessments across various modalities, maximizing the breadth and depth of services provided to Veterans in rural areas.
Collaboration among TMH programs will be useful to creatively and effectively address resource related issues, as programs develop to meet the needs of Veterans presenting with complicated presenting problems.The VA NYH TMH Hub works closely with technical staff to manage technology updates for services to Veterans’ homes to ameliorate the challenges of managing technological and equipment difficulties.
Additionally, plans to condense meetings on a rotating basis will be piloted, to increase availability of Hub psychologists, while still providing sufficient support to meet the Hub’s mission and VA’s larger goals.In consideration of expanding opportunities for training and expert consultation within TMH, it will be useful to look at applications of the Extension for Community Health Care Outcomes model.
As a future quality improvement project, the experience of staff at the spoke sites is being gathered through a brief self-report questionnaire and qualitative telephone interview with TCTs, clinicians, and leadership, with the goal of continuing to revise procedures and protocols by incorporating spoke site feedback.Identifying barriers and facilitators to program implementation provides a framework for the initiation and development of new Hubs, monitoring and improving structures and processes, and enhancing the effectiveness of mental health care in rural populations.
The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan increased the need for mental health providers trained to deliver evidence-based treatments to veterans diagnosed with a range of mental health issues including posttraumatic stress disorder, mood disorders, anxiety disorders, and substance use disorders.
The NTMHC clinicians provide expertise in the treatment of affective, psychotic, anxiety and substance use disorders and operate out of the VA Boston, VA Connecticut Health care System, Philadelphia Veterans Affairs Medical Center, and Providence VAMC.VHA TMH services are provided through multiple treatment modalities, including individual, group, couples and family psychotherapies, as well as medication management.
In addition to increasing veteran access to mental health services, the mission of the VA NYH TMH Hub also includes providing training to students and other VHA clinicians in the delivery of TMH and conducting program evaluation as well as research to advance knowledge and promote innovation in TMH services.VA NYH TMH providers use Cisco DX80 devices or Logitech webcams to administer TMH treatment.
Additionally, a standing weekly VA NYH TMH Hub Psychology Staff Peer Supervision/Case Conference was held to address clinical issues that arose and to discuss the unique aspects of delivering services via TMH.Within five months of beginning to offer mental health interventions, the service reached its preestablished productivity goals of 80 veteran encounters per month, per provider for the first year.
Providers that practice using family systems approaches to treatment may be particularly helpful in advancing global mental health strategies that are culturally sensitive and responsive to patient needs and preferences.Global Proofing in BrazilThe political, economic, social, and care environment in Brazil makes this an ideal place to proof this model on a global scale.
Most commonly cited barriers included difficulty discussing personal matters, lack of trust of VA system, an inflexible VA system, and lack of outreach to American Indian and Hispanic American communities.Over the last one and one-half decades, we developed a real-time, interactive videoconference delivery model to meet the special mental health care needs of the rural AI/AN Veteran population.",0.0019931578164509886
