Research suggests that as many as half of veterans with mental health conditions go untreated due to barriers including lack of accessibility to services and stigma. The present study builds on previous research by using meta-analytic techniques to determine the effectiveness of telepsychology-delivered therapy with veterans. Empirical studies were included if they reported veteran-related outcome data on a psychological intervention used to treat a mental health condition remotely using either videoconferencing or telephone. Twenty-seven studies including 2,648 total participants (1,667 in treatment conditions and 981 in control conditions) met our inclusion criteria and were incorporated into our analysis. Twenty-five studies provided pre–post data to evaluate various therapy outcomes, and 18 studies used a randomized clinical trials (RCTs) design that allowed a comparison between telehealth and traditional in-person therapy. Publication bias was evaluated using correlations between sample and effect sizes for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression for pretest–posttest and RCT designs; risk was determined to be minimal. Weighted average pre–post effect sizes were moderate-to-strong for depression and trauma, and videoconferencing was more effective than telephone for depression (d = 0.86 and 0.46, respectively) and trauma (d = 1.00 and 0.51, respectively). Weighted average effect sizes computed from RCT studies suggest telepsychology is similarly effective as services provided face-to-face. More research is needed for telepsychology-delivered treatments for other mental health conditions faced by veterans.
Impact Statement

Only about half of veterans who meet criteria for a mental health condition obtain treatment due to barriers including service accessibility and embarrassment associated with waiting in line at provider offices. Telepsychology, specifically videoconferencing and telephone, can help reduce these barriers to treatment by eliminating some challenges associated with geographic distances to providers, and by allowing patients to skip office visits. Services delivered by technology are an effective way to alleviate mental health symptoms in this population and are comparable to services provided face-to-face.","KEYWORDS:

CCEs are perhaps the most complex of all forensic evaluations, requiring complex, multifaceted assessments of multiple parties and their relationships in order to address the best interests of the child. Attempting these evaluations via videoconferencing should be done carefully and only after consideration of numerous factors, including whether this alternative can be safely and reliably accomplished. This article outlines the conceptual approach used by the child custody community for determining the foci of the evaluation, tailoring data collection via multiple methodologies, and analyzing the data. The article reviews the empirical literature demonstrating that professional relationships and various clinical and forensic processes have reliably and successfully used videoconferencing with adults, children, and different clinical and forensic populations. The article also outlines how evaluators conducting RCCEs must comply with the ethical demands of their discipline or profession, as well as ethical demands unique to remote service delivery. Finally, the article addresses how evaluators can prepare for challenges to their work that are based upon the standards for admissibility of expert witness testimony. The limitations of videoconferencing, including limitations specific to the demands of RCCEs, are also reviewed.","KEYWORDS:

It includes the procurement, storage, sharing, and provision of forensic mental health information and services via electronic means and is associated with improved accessibility, efficiency, cost-savings, and safety. During the COVID-19 pandemic, clinics, hospitals, jails, prisons, and the courts rapidly adopted these modalities for service continuity out of necessity, rather than choice. In the absence of formal guidelines, practitioners, researchers, and policymakers were left searching for answers: what forensic e-mental health technologies are available, what was their research evidence, and what could the future hold? A “primer” covering the many aspects of technology-assisted forensic practice and research was overdue. To address this knowledge gap, we reviewed the e-mental health research base encompassing forensic evaluations and interventions. Considering stakeholders’ needs, cost, and feasibility, we prioritized key topics that should rise to the top of the forensic e-mental health research agenda: the psychometric properties of forensic e-mental health assessments, impact of video recording evaluations, how to assess and treat diverse populations, restoration of competence to proceed, continuum of care, minimizing treatment attrition, and decreasing substance use. We report how to plan for and overcome logistical hurdles when implementing forensic e-mental health policy, utilize technology for training and education, and harness digitized data across the forensic realm.

As student leaders of an American university training clinic, we briefly address the pandemic and rise of telepsychology, and then present five practical suggestions and five core curricula recommendations to aid clinics in adapting to meet the educational needs of trainees using telepsychology during this unprecedented time. We conclude by offering structure and content suggestions for a four-session intensive workshop to provide trainees and supervisors alike with a telepsychology “primer” prior to providing services. In particular, we suggest training clinics adopt telepsychology best practice guidelines rather than adopt the mindset of implementing a temporary solution for providing services during the pandemic. Through this mindset, student psychotherapists are given an enriching training opportunity and clinics will be better postured to iteratively improve and tailor telepsychology services to meet the needs of the populations they serve.
Public Significance Statement

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, university training clinics have been faced with the task of rapidly transitioning from an in-person model to telepsychology. This manuscript offers student-perspective guidance and practical suggestions to help training clinics adapt to meet the evolving training needs of doctoral students and increase trainee and supervisory competence in the provision of telepsychology during this unprecedented time.","KEYWORDS:

The necessity of delivering health care safely within the lockdown and shelter-in-place mandates compelled psychotherapists to shift their practices away from providing in-person services to offering synchronous remote psychotherapy instead. This abrupt transition presented a unique and multifaceted challenge in terms of the service location; as therapists’ houses effectively became their offices, their homes no longer served as purely personal spaces. Instead, psychotherapists needed their living environments to fulfill a dual function as a clinical office space that would be shared with their clients, albeit at a distance. This mixed-method study focused on assessing psychotherapists’ most significant challenges and specific adaptations to this experience of providing remote therapy from home during the Covid-19 pandemic. Findings from the study revealed that the shared trauma experienced as a result of the pandemic, the unexpected and sudden transition to the new therapeutic setting, and “Zoom fatigue” were among the most significant challenges faced by therapists. The participants also demonstrated great resilience as they found creative ways to adapt and continue their meaningful work with their clients. This was especially true for those working with children. Ultimately, the participants had mixed feelings about the possibility of returning to the office setting.
Clinical Impact Statement

The Covid-19 pandemic will have a lasting impact on the delivery of psychotherapy treatment. This mixed-method study assessed psychotherapists’ most significant challenges when conducting remote psychotherapy sessions from their homes. The study’s findings cover both the challenges and the strategies used to navigate them.","KEYWORDS:

The purpose of this study was to document the magnitude of that effect by examining (a) the amount of psychologists’ telepsychology use before the COVID-19 pandemic, during the pandemic, and anticipated use after the pandemic; as well as (b) the demographic, training, policy, and clinical practice predictors of these changes. This study used a cross-sectional, national online design to recruit 2,619 licensed psychologists practicing in the United States. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, psychologists performed 7.07% of their clinical work with telepsychology, which increased 12-fold to 85.53% during the pandemic, with 67.32% of psychologists conducting all of their clinical work with telepsychology. Psychologists projected that they would perform 34.96% of their clinical work via telepsychology after the pandemic. Psychologists working in outpatient treatment facilities reported over a 26-fold increase in telepsychology use during the pandemic, while those in Veterans Affairs medical centers only reported a sevenfold increase. A larger increase in percentage telepsychology use occurred in women, in psychologists who reported an increase in telepsychology training and supportive organizational telepsychology policies, and in psychologists who treated relationship issues, anxiety, and women’s issues. The lowest increases in percentage telepsychology use were reported by psychologists working in rural areas, treating antisocial personality disorder, performing testing and evaluation, and treating rehabilitation populations. Although there was a remarkable increase in telepsychology use during the COVID-19 pandemic, individual and practice characteristics affected psychologists’ ability to adopt telepsychology.
Public Significance Statement

The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a literal revolution in mental health care delivery, shifting the vast majority of psychological services to telepsychology. This study conducted a national survey of licensed psychologists and documented this seismic shift, finding that although 7.07% of psychologists’ clinical work was performed via telepsychology before the COVID-19 pandemic, this increased 12-fold to 85.53% during the pandemic. Psychologists were optimistic that over one-third of their clinical work would still occur via telepsychology after the pandemic, suggesting the high likelihood of lasting changes in U.S. mental health care delivery.","KEYWORDS:

This study examined pre-COVID-19 deterrents reported by psychologists who did not use telepsychology. Participants were 1,400 psychologists with an average of 26.3 (SD = 11.18) years in practice who were currently practicing within the United States but did not currently use telepsychology. All 50 states were represented as well as Washington, DC. The most commonly reported deterrents, from most to least frequent, were insufficient training, client safety/crisis concerns, privacy, legality, ethics, reimbursement, efficacy, prohibitive organizational policies/culture, and insufficient demand. Logistic regression analyses suggested that psychologists’ deterrents varied based in part on demographic and practice characteristics. Psychologists practicing within medical centers or Veterans Affairs facilities were less likely to indicate safety, privacy, legal issues, ethics, and efficacy as a concern. Older psychologists were less deterred by reimbursement issues and more concerned about effectiveness. Those using cognitive–behavioral approaches were less likely to report efficacy and safety concerns. Cisgender men were less likely to be deterred by safety or privacy issues, and White psychologists were less likely to indicate safety as a deterrent. Additional telepsychology training and information for psychologists may increase its use and foster improved mental health care access for populations unable to attend in-person sessions. A more focused approach to training and implementation of telepsychology that considers the needs and concerns of the target psychologist group could benefit organizations promoting its use.
Impact Statement

Psychologists not using telepsychology before COVID-19 most reported lack of training, safety concerns, privacy, legality, ethics, reimbursement, efficacy, prohibitive organizational policies/culture, and low patient demand. Psychologists’ deterrents varied based in part on demographic and practice characteristics. Organizations promoting or implementing telepsychology should employ an approach that considers and addresses the particular needs of the psychologists with whom they work.","KEYWORDS:

Since the onset of the pandemic, mental illness has increased and demand for resources and services are on the rise. COVID-19 has served as a catalyst for the rapid implementation and acceptance of telemental health as a psychological service delivery option. Telemental health has several benefits, including increased reach and accessibility for those living in rural areas, reduced treatment attrition, and cost savings due to reduced travel. Although telemental health may be an innovative solution for broadly delivering psychological services, it can also pose threats to confidentiality and is limited to individuals with accessibility to the Internet and capability to navigate online platforms. Telemental health may also not be appropriate for individuals with severe mental illness (e.g., active psychosis, suicidality), who require in-person services to mitigate acute risk, or in situations in which a high degree of confidentiality is critical for accurate disclosure (e.g., child maltreatment, domestic violence). In this commentary, we describe the benefits and challenges of telemental health, and also highlight important considerations for clinicians, children and youth, systems that coordinate and facilitate mental health services, and future research. We conclude that telemental health is not a panacea and requires careful consideration for appropriateness depending on client needs and confidentiality, and standards for ensuring optimal outcomes for clients.

Such evaluations have largely halted during the COVID-19 crisis, with questionable psychometrics of usable measures and clinicians largely unprepared to administer them. Remote, online psychoeducational evaluations have the potential to decrease this access problem by allowing for evaluations to continue during the crisis, as well as redistributing (geographically and potentially socioeconomically) evaluators to populations disproportionately without access. The present study evaluated the equivalence of a remote, online administration procedure for the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, Fifth Edition (WISC-V) with traditional, in-person administration. Results revealed no significant differences—and, therefore, method effects—between the full-scale IQ and index scores between the administration procedures. One subtest did reveal a significant method effect, with children performing more poorly on the remote, online version of the test. Although imperfect, the remote, online procedure is a viable alternative for the traditional, in-person administration of the WISC-V, especially during this time of crisis.
Public Significance Statement

This article evaluates whether the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, Fifth Edition, given in a remote, online format produces equivalent results as the traditional, in-person administration of the test, as it was developed and meant to be used. The findings reveal how evaluators can use the test in a telehealth context, to continue cognitive evaluations during the COVID-19 crisis, as well as ongoing afterward for students without access to evaluation services.","KEYWORDS:

For training clinics tasked with educating the next generation of health service psychologists, providing vital mental health care to the community, and conducting clinical research, the pandemic offers an opportunity to consider how best to fulfill these crucial missions during a time of global uncertainty. The present paper reviews the recent, rapid move to telepsychology among North American university training clinics in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and offers relevant suggestions for mental health service providers rapidly transitioning to telepsychology moving forward. Data summarizing the response of university training clinics in health service psychology in the United States and Canada to physical distancing guidelines are presented, and considerations regarding best practices in service delivery and supervision via telepsychology are provided. While the present data focus on North American training clinics, the suggestions offered are relevant to any clinic tasked with providing high quality services and training mental health providers via telepsychology, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic. Given the growing emphasis within health service psychology on increasing access to mental health services via telepsychology prior to the pandemic, as well as the benefits to psychology trainees in gaining competence in this valuable form of service delivery, this paper aims to provide timely guidance around the benefits, risks, and practical considerations regarding the maintenance of effective clinical care in training settings when rapidly implementing telepsychology.","KEYWORDS:

Crucially, the value of this special issue goes beyond the current crisis, enabling psychotherapists to be better prepared for physical distancing situations that they may face in the future.","KEYWORDS:

The knowledge and skills necessary for competent practice are being introduced into training programs; however, psychologists who are practicing independently have no formal means to prepare for this expansion in their scope of practice. This primer for practice leads readers through the clinical, technical, and logistical steps necessary for preparation, initiation, and participation in telepsychology. Topics discussed include overcoming barriers and increasing one’s opportunities (e.g., geographical, financial, transportation); competencies, standards of care, and ethical considerations (e.g., adaptation of informed consent and confidentiality agreements, electronic recordkeeping and storage); what one needs to know for implementation (e.g., Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act and the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act); interjurisdictional practice (e.g., legal status); action steps; and resources. Psychologists beginning to incorporate technology into their practices as well as those with technical competence will note several features that lend guidance to the basic elements of practice: (a) Risk management tips are offered throughout the article, (b) an informed consent checklist for self-assessment is presented, and (c) a checklist for hardware disposal and software removal is detailed. Practitioners who are curious about telepsychology but do not know how to inquire or where to begin are offered clear direction and important information on how to incorporate telepsychology into existing practices or to begin a purely telepsychological practice.
Clinical Impact Statement

This article is focused on the population of practitioners who have primarily engaged in traditional in-person service and realizes telepsychology can impact their practices but are not equipped to participate without foundational information. That information is presented here in a stepwise, practical manner that explains application and implementation, which contributes to increased competency of the practitioners.","KEYWORDS:

The information contained in this article is based on a literature review, a needs and preferences survey of this population (n = 49 persons with CLRD; n = 49 informal caregivers) that was part of a larger study (Enhancing Rural Interventions for Caregiver Health [En-Rich]), and our clinical experience. The En-Rich needs and preferences survey was conducted to help shape telehealth services for this population particularly those residing in rural/geographically isolated areas as well as those who are not physically well enough to attend clinic-based appointments. As a result of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, the use of telehealth services for clinical care has dramatically risen for a variety of reasons. We surmise that persons with CLRD and their informal caregivers are particularly open to telehealth services at this time, given the risk of exposure to the virus upon leaving their homes. As such, we provide information about the physical and psychosocial aspects of living with CLRD from the perspective of patients and informal caregivers along with 7 practical recommendations for providing telehealth services to this population. Our aim is to better equip telehealth clinicians who are working with this special population through our interdisciplinary lens (gerontology, nursing, health psychology, and social work).
Clinical Impact Statement

A formal literature review, needs and preferences survey, and our interdisciplinary clinical expertise shaped our recommendations for the provision of telehealth education and emotional support for persons with chronic lower respiratory disease (CLRD) and their informal caregivers. The recommendations were written in the context of COVID-19 pandemic which has increased the need for telehealth services for this clinical population as well as empirically supported education for the clinicians who serve them.","KEYWORDS:

The widespread fear, helplessness, illness and death, economic hardship, and disruption of social support caused by the pandemic will create a global need for both supportive crisis counseling and formal mental health treatment. As physical distancing aimed at reducing contagion sharply limits in-person contact, psychotherapists have suddenly been forced to adopt new technologies and learn to provide telepsychotherapy. At this same time, psychotherapists must contend with their own stressors as part of the pandemic-exposed population. We integrate several different literatures to outline how telepsychotherapy can help psychotherapists address patient needs during this pandemic. We review epidemiological literature on the mental health impact of pandemics, crisis counseling approaches developed from prior disasters, and clinical research on telepsychotherapy treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder. Based on this research, we provide a roadmap for ways that clinicians can use telepsychotherapy technologies for 2 levels of intervention: (1) providing strengths-based preventive interventions to help people cope with distress during a period of disruption, life-threat, and loss, and (2) delivering effective treatments to people who develop chronic conditions in response to traumatic stress.","KEYWORDS:

Much research has been done demonstrating the acceptability and effectiveness of telepsychology. Also, it has been shown that evidence-based psychotherapies and pharmacological therapies can be delivered effectively through telepsychology; however, there is a lack of information on how to best adapt the research-supported protocols to be delivered via telepsychology. A recent survey of telepsychology experts demonstrated the need for guidance on how to adapt these practices for telepsychology with a specific focus on three domains: use of self-report questionnaires, treatment handouts, and in-session examples (Gros et al., 2013). The presented case series demonstrates feasible solutions to address these domains of treatment such as using screen-sharing technology, incorporating other technology-based resources such as smart-phone applications, and using web-based methods to securely administer outcome tracking measures. Further research and innovation on the topic is needed.

Workshops, ongoing consultation, and feedback provided in person are effective yet are rarely feasible for clinicians in the field (Fixsen, Blase, Duda, Naoom, & Van Dyke, 2010). The purpose of the present study was to conduct a preliminary assessment of an online tutorial combined with live remote coaching for training mental health professionals in behavioral parent training. Participants in this pretest–posttest open trial were 22 clinicians and graduate students (73% female) from around the United States. The web platform operated successfully, and clinicians found the training to be highly satisfactory. Compared with pretraining, participants demonstrated large improvements in knowledge about disruptive behavior and behavioral parent training and performed significantly better on demonstrations of skill in administering behavioral parent-training components. An online course combined with live remote coaching is a promising methodology for significantly increasing the number of clinicians trained in evidence-based interventions for disruptive behavior in children. Next steps for evaluation and expansion of this training model are discussed.

This is a barrier to mental health services for millions of people needing help but are limited by time or distance from traditional in-person therapy. The purpose of this study was to identify demographic, organizational, and clinical statistical predictors of psychologists’ use of telepsychology in their clinical practice. The sample consisted of 1,791 psychologists currently practicing psychotherapy, representing all 50 U.S. states, and averaging more than 26 years in practice. Results suggested that psychologists were much more likely to use telepsychology if they practiced in organizations where policies supporting telepsychology exist, more likely if they had received telepsychology training, and less likely if they were practicing in rural areas. Psychologists were more likely to use telepsychology if they practiced in Veterans Affairs Medical Centers or within an individual or group practice. Use of telepsychology was higher for psychologists focusing on sports performance and life coaching, as well as lower for psychologists providing testing and evaluation and when treating grief. The implications for psychologists and the settings they practice within are considered. Organizations interested in encouraging telepsychology use should adopt policies supporting the use of telepsychology and provide adequate training to do so.
Public Significance Statement

Telepsychology can help psychologists reach underserved communities, but only 21% of psychologists in the current study reported using telepsychology within their practice. Results of the study suggest that organizations promoting telepsychology use should craft specific policies supporting its use and provide psychologists adequate training.","KEYWORDS:

This transition to electronic means of client data storage has resulted in greater efficiencies, improved integrated care, and loss prevention. However, moving to digital means of record keeping involves novel legal and ethical consequences, which have been reviewed by various authors (e.g., Devereaux and Gottlieb (2012) and the APA’s, 2007 Record Keeping Guidelines). Importantly, unexamined to date are concerns associated with data after death—specifically, when a mental health provider who uses technology for record keeping unexpectedly departs via incapacitation, death, or other unknown circumstances. These circumstances may prevent continuity of care and access to data among survivors. This article reviews the current use of digital record keeping, federal and state policies, legal and ethical standards, and provides forward-looking recommendations for professionals.

In recent years, there has been growth in the delivery of psychological interventions through web-based modalities, that is, telepsychology. Although there is evidence supporting the usability and feasibility of telepsychology for a range of populations, there is limited literature on clinician perceptions delivering telepsychology, particularly to pediatric rehabilitation populations. In this mixed-methods study, we report on clinician perspectives and experiences delivering telepsychology to children/families impacted by pediatric traumatic brain injury. Method: Seventeen clinicians (psychologists and advanced psychology doctoral students) who delivered telepsychology interventions to children/families impacted by pediatric brain injuries completed surveys and interviews. Results: Overall, clinicians reported that telepsychology was equivalent to face-to-face treatment in many regards (e.g., therapeutic alliance, weekly progress, child/family engagement, and establishing rapport). Clinicians reported a number of advantages of telepsychology over face-to-face interventions for this pediatric population including greater ease of scheduling, increased understanding of the family and home environments, and less caregiver stigma of behavioral health care. Disadvantages of telepsychology included difficulties reading nonverbal cues, logistical/technological issues, and greater disruptions during sessions. Conclusions: Findings provide an important foundation for future investigations examining the merits of telepsychology versus traditional treatment for both pediatric rehabilitation populations.
Impact and Implications

This study elucidates several advantages and disadvantages of utilizing telepsychology in comparison with face-to-face therapy for family-centered treatment of pediatric traumatic brain injury from a clinician perspective. Overall, clinicians reported that telepsychology was superior to face-to-face therapy in terms of scheduling/attendance, understanding the family and home environments, and reducing behavioral health stigma. Clinicians reported several challenges with utilizing telepsychology; the most prominent including distractions and reading nonverbal cues. Findings from this study provide an important foundation for future investigations examining the merits of telepsychology versus traditional treatment for pediatric populations.","KEYWORDS:

The aim of this rapid evidence assessment was to assess the evidence for synchronous telepsychology interventions for 4 common mental health conditions (depression, anxiety, posttraumatic stress disorder, and adjustment disorder). Randomized controlled trials published between 2005 and 2016 that investigated synchronous telepsychology (i.e., telephone delivered, video teleconference delivered, or Internet delivered text based) were identified through literature searches. From an initial yield of 2,266 studies, 24 were included in the review. Ten studies investigated the effectiveness of telephone-delivered interventions, 11 investigated the effectiveness of video teleconference (VTC) interventions, 2 investigated Internet-delivered text-based interventions, and 2 were reviews of multiple telepsychology modalities. There was sufficient evidence to support VTC and telephone-delivered interventions for mental health conditions. The evidence for synchronous Internet-delivered text-based interventions was ranked as “unknown.” Telephone-delivered and VTC-delivered psychological interventions provide a mode of treatment delivery that can potentially overcome barriers and increase access to psychological interventions.","KEYWORDS:

Of this group, 23.5% reside in poverty and 24.3% lack health insurance (Lewis, 2017). Latinx populations have the highest uninsured rate compared to other ethnic/racial groups in the United States (DeNavas-Walt, Proctor, & Lee, 2006). Unfortunately, systemic and structural factors contribute to disparate health outcomes for this population. Rural Latinx immigrant populations face even greater barriers to access adequate behavioral and medical health care. Informed by the Psychosocial Stress Model of Health Disparities, this article argues for the utility of integrated behavioral health care to reduce health disparities among racial-ethnic minority groups, most especially rural Latinx immigrants. Moreover, we recommend the integration of telepsychology services to further enhance access to care for this population. Academic training programs are positioned well to establish these services and positively impact health disparities. We outline a psychosocial and contextually driven solution to establish integrated telepsychology behavioral health care training clinics. Specific details regarding the establishment of integrated behavioral health care specialty training, and recommendations for the utility of telepsychology, are provided.

Hospitals, mental health facilities, and other clinics face the challenge of providing continued care to a population that is under severe stress, while minimizing in-person visits that risk spreading the virus. The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) is the largest integrated health care system in the United States, providing care at 1,286 sites. VHA ensured the continuity of mental health services after the COVID-19 outbreak by rapidly expanding its use of telemental health methods in the first weeks after the U.S. pandemic outbreak. VHA provided nearly 1.2 million telephone and video encounters to veterans in April 2020 and reduced in-person visits by approximately 80% when compared with the October 2019 to February 2020 period before the pandemic. By June 2020, VHA had an 11-fold increase in encounters using direct-to-home video and a fivefold increase in telephone contacts relative to before the pandemic.

Public Significance Statement

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has increased psychological stress but made it harder for people to safely access mental health treatment. To address this challenge, the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) scaled up delivery of mental health care by video teleconferencing and telephone during the first 4 months of the pandemic.

To ensure quality care, clinicians need skills, knowledge, and attitudes related to technology that can be measured. This study sought out competencies for asynchronous technologies and/or an approach to define them. Methods: This 6-stage scoping review of Pubmed/Medline, APA PsycNET, PsycINFO and other databases was based on a broad research question, “What skills are needed for clinicians and trainees to provide quality care using asynchronous technologies for children and adolescents, and how can they be made measurable to implement, teach and evaluate?” The search focused on key words in 4 concept areas: (a) competencies; (b) asynchronous technology; (c) synchronous telepsychiatry, telebehavioral or telemental health; and (d) clinical. The screeners reviewed the full-text articles based on inclusion (mesh of the key words) and exclusion criteria. Results: From a total of 5,877 potential references, 2 authors found 509 eligible for full text review and found 110 articles directly relevant to the concepts. Clinical studies discuss clinical, technical and administrative workflow rather than competencies, though behavioral health professions’ position statements advise on adapting care and training. Existing technology competencies for video, social media, mobile health, and other asynchronous technologies were used to build a framework. Training, faculty development, and organizational suggestions are suggested. Conclusions: Research is needed on how to implement and evaluate asynchronous competencies to ensure quality clinical care and training, which is a paradigm shift for participants.
Public Significance Statement

Newer technologies such as mobile phones, iPads, social media and apps add opportunities for life, and these and others may facilitate self-care, promote health and communication with providers. To ensure quality care, clinicians need measurable skills, knowledge and attitudes to use these technologies, and they have to adjust clinical, technical and administrative workflow. A competency framework was built for training, faculty development and organizational change, and research is needed on how to implement and evaluate the impact on health care.","KEYWORDS:

This systematic review examined providers' attitudes toward TMH-V through the lens of the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT). Findings suggest that providers have positive overall attitudes toward TMH-V despite describing multiple drawbacks. Therefore, the relative advantages of TMH-V, such as its ability to increase access to care, may outweigh its disadvantages, including technological problems, increased hassle, and perceptions of impersonality. Providers' attitudes may also be related to their degree of prior TMH-V experience, and acceptance may increase with use. Limitations and implications of findings for implementation efforts are discussed.
Public Health Significance

Mental health providers can conduct appointments remotely via videoconferencing, a form of telemental health (TMH-V) which can increase access to care for patients who live far from specialty providers or have difficulty leaving their homes. It is important to understand providers' attitudes toward this technology, as they play a crucial role in whether this service will be widely adopted by health-care systems and will therefore be offered to patients. The current review found that providers feel positive toward TMH-V despite reporting multiple drawbacks; this suggests that the relative advantages of TMH-V, such as its ability to increase access to care, may outweigh its disadvantages, including technological problems, increased hassle, and perceptions of feeling impersonal.","KEYWORDS:

A feasible and effective alternative to traditional in-person care, telemental health requires that clinicians adopt new strategies to build and maintain communication and the therapeutic relationship. This can be particularly troublesome for clinicians new to the modality, who may feel the loss of the “in-session” experience more acutely. As an evidence-based practice that is transtheoretical and transdiagnostic, telemental health measurement-based care (tMBC) is the ideal complement to enhance systematic ongoing monitoring, treatment engagement, and therapeutic alliance in the context of the virtual encounter. While tMBC mechanisms of actions are still being explored, there is promising evidence that tMBC improves clinician responsivity to acute client concerns. By using client-reported measures, tMBC provides an important pathway for clients to systematically communicate with their clinicians, which can guide therapeutic actions and contribute to shared understanding. This brief report summarizes the evidence for tMBC as a patient-centered communication tool and provides recommendations for evidence-based and practice-informed strategies to integrate tMBC into telehealth solutions, with suggestions for monitoring new concerns related to the COVID-19 crisis.

Although recent research has supported the effectiveness of telehealth delivery of a variety of interventions for children, the literature has focused very little on childhood posttraumatic stress disorder. This pilot study examined the feasibility and potential effectiveness of trauma-focused cognitive–behavioral therapy (TF-CBT) delivered via telepsychotherapy in community-based locations of either schools or patient homes. Telepsychotherapy treatment was delivered to 70 trauma-exposed youth in 7 underserved communities. Of these, 88.6% completed a full course of TF-CBT and 96.8% of these treatment completers no longer met diagnostic criteria for a trauma-related disorder at posttreatment. Results demonstrated clinically meaningful symptom change posttreatment, with large effect sizes evident for both youth- and caregiver-reported reduction in posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms. The results observed in this pilot evaluation are promising and provide preliminary evidence of the feasibility and effectiveness of this novel treatment format. The COVID-19 global pandemic has resulted in an unprecedented need to rethink how mental health services are delivered, which is particularly applicable to high base rate conditions related to posttraumatic stress. Given the existing network of nationally certified TF-CBT therapists, and many international TF-CBT therapists, these findings suggest the potential for providing effective and accessible telepsychotherapy intervention during this public health crisis (as well as those that will occur in the future).","KEYWORDS:

The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs’ (VA) Telemental Health Hub (TMH) initiative started in 2002 to address the mental health needs of rural Veterans and has been increasingly used since that time. Services are typically provided from a VA medical center (VAMC) to a VA community-based outpatient clinic, as well as to Veterans’ homes. The VA NY Harbor Health Care System TMH Hub (VA NYH TMH Hub) was established in 2016 through funding from VA’s Office of Rural Health. Since March 2017, the VA NYH TMH Hub has provided individual, couples, and group therapy, as well as neuropsychological and psychodiagnostic testing to Veterans in rural New York and Iowa. As the TMH initiative continues to grow, it is increasingly important to understand program development, particularly barriers and facilitators to support ongoing growth. The present article examines factors that enhance and challenge the provision of psychotherapy via TMH, as experienced by TMH psychologists. Reflections are based on discussions among nine TMH psychologists regarding their experiences providing TMH treatment, generated and categorized during weekly staff and peer supervision meetings. Administrative, technical, and clinical barriers and facilitators are discussed. Unique considerations are also discussed, related to the structure of the VA NYH TMH Hub and the ways in which the therapeutic relationship may be impacted by TMH.

Mirroring TMH, telesupervision is potentially advantageous and may offer benefits above and beyond in-person supervision to include increased accessibility of training, reduced cost for travel and improved flexibility of scheduling, and increased access for peer consultation. These benefits may contribute to greater diversity of training and supervision experiences for trainees as well. In this evidence-based practice project, former psychology trainees (N = 12) at 1 Veterans Affairs Health Care System (VA) site were invited to complete an anonymous online questionnaire regarding their supervision experiences utilizing both quantitative and qualitative items to explore trainee perceptions of telesupervision implementation, satisfaction, and efficacy. Both the qualitative and quantitative data suggest equivalence between the telesupervision and in-person supervision experiences with regard to rapport with supervisors and focus on clinical goals and tasks. The qualitative data provide additional insight into the trainee perspective on the benefits related to engaging in telesupervision, challenges related to engaging in telesupervision, and components of successful telesupervision. Telesupervision has the potential to contribute to the sustainability of rural health training programs, to increase access to needed mental health care in geographical areas of mental health shortage, and to allow trainees to receive supervision from supervisors who are culturally competent and expert in providing care to diverse patient populations. This article offers suggestions for optimal practice of telesupervision and discusses implications for training programs going forward.

With the increased prevalence of depression in farmers, it is important to understand the role of social support as a protective factor in the development of depressive symptoms in farmers. One hundred seventy-two farmers completed the Major Depression Inventory (MDI) and the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS). Mean MDI and MSPSS scores were compared between men and women. Multivariate linear regression adjusting for military service, age, and gender were used with MSPSS as the outcome variable to determine the effect of social support on MSPSS scores. Moderating effects of gender and military service on the social support subscales were tested using Gender × Subscale and Military Service × Subscale interactions. On the MDI, 8.7% of the farmers reported mild, moderate, or severe depressive symptoms, and 13.3% reported feeling that life was not worth living at least some of the time. Higher scores on the MSPSS subscales and the total score were all associated with lower MDI scores. In the final model, the Friend subscale remained significant (β = 0.22, p = .02), and the Family subscale showed a trend toward significance (β = 1.7, p = .08). These results indicate the importance of social support from friends and family members in the prevention of depressive symptoms in farmers.

Administrative and, to some extent, clinical considerations of these clinics have been reviewed previously. This paper describes a model of care, evolved over a 14-year period, that weaves together evidence-based Western treatment, traditional Native healing, and rural Native communities into 4 main components: mental health care, technology, care coordination, and cultural facilitation. We delineate improvements to care made by addressing barriers such as system transference, provider-patient trust, and videoconferencing. Similarly, the discussion notes ways that the care model leverages strengths within Native communities, such as social cohesion and spirituality. Future steps include selection of appropriate performance indicators for systematic evaluation. The identification of key constructs of this care model will facilitate comparisons with other models of care in underserved populations with chronic and complex health conditions, and eventually advance the state of care for our warriors.","KEYWORDS:

Major assessments were conducted at baseline, midtreatment, posttreatment, and 6-month follow-up. Linear regressions and hierarchical linear modeling using maximum-likelihood estimation were used to analyze treatment satisfaction, diagnoses, symptoms, functioning, and burden to parents across conditions. Results: Intent-to-treat analyses found 70% and 55% of children treated with I-PCIT and clinic-based PCIT, respectively, showed “treatment response” after treatment, and 55% and 40% of children treated with I-PCIT and clinic-based PCIT, respectively, continued to show “treatment response” at 6-month follow-up. Both treatments had significant effects on children’s symptoms and burden to parents, and many effects were very large in magnitude. Most outcomes were comparable across conditions, except that the rate of posttreatment “excellent response” was significantly higher in I-PCIT than in clinic-based PCIT, and I-PCIT was associated with significantly fewer parent-perceived barriers to treatment than clinic-based PCIT. Both treatments were associated with positive engagement, treatment retention, and very high treatment satisfaction. Conclusion: Findings build on the small but growing literature supporting the promising role of new technologies for expanding the delivery of behavioral parent training.
What is the public health significance of this article?

This study provides the first evidence from a controlled trial supporting the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of leveraging video-teleconferencing technology to remotely deliver live parent training to the home setting. With continued support, such a format may play an important role in improving the accessibility and scope of supported treatments for traditionally underserved populations by overcoming geographic barriers to quality mental health care and extending the reach of evidence-based treatment providers.","KEYWORDS:
