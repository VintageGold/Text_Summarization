              "\"Veterans face a variety of stressors related to their military service (Institute of Medicine, 2014; Tanielian et al., 2008). Most veterans who return from military conflict do not have a mental health condition, but all veterans “experience a period of readjustment as they reintegrate into life with family, friends, and community” (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration [SAMHSA], 2012, p. 1; Tanielian et al., 2008). Those individuals must juggle a variety of sometimes conflicting family and military-related responsibilities, learn to readjust to environments where behaviors associated with a constant state of readiness are no longer needed, and process combat-related exposure that may collectively contribute to problems for both veterans and their families (Institute of Medicine, 2014; SAMHSA, 2012).Veterans who are exposed to combat are more likely to report normal reactions to stress including depression, hopelessness, insomnia, nightmares, feelings of rejection, aggressive behavior, and substance misuse (SAMHSA, 2012). They also report higher levels of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), major depression, generalized anxiety, intermittent explosive disorder, and substance misuse after returning from conflict (Lazar, 2014; SAMHSA, 2012; Tanielian et al., 2008). Veterans with PTSD and major depression are also frequently diagnosed with other comorbid mental health-related diagnoses, experience elevated death rates from suicide and homicide, report more work-related problems such as unemployment, and are more likely to be homeless than the average person (Lazar, 2014).Many veterans are not receiving adequate mental health treatment for these conditions (Lazar, 2014; Tanielian et al., 2008). Lazar (2014) surveyed veterans who returned from conflict in Iraq and Afghanistan and found that only 23%–40% with a diagnosable mental health condition reported receiving help from a provider in the previous year. Although the percentages of those who meet criteria for a diagnosis and subsequently seek treatment vary (23%–40% in the Lazar study vs. 53% in the Tanielian study), it is clear that many veterans who are returning from conflict are not receiving adequate treatment for their mental health-related problems. Collectively, the Lazar (2014) and the Tanielian et al. (2008) studies suggest that the problem is potentially related to veterans either not choosing to seek services or a shortage of providers located near the veteran.A number of barriers that prevent veterans who are in distress from seeking mental health services have been presented in the literature (United States Government Accountability Office [USGAO], 2011; Tanielian et al., 2008). Those barriers include the following: (a) lack of access to mental health services (e.g., lack of transportation to a provider, the distance that veterans must travel to obtain services is too far, etc.), (b) negative stigma associated with utilizing mental health services (e.g., concerns about how other individuals will view them if they found out about the veteran seeking treatment), (c) lack of awareness of mental health conditions or treatments such as whether their symptoms rise to the level of a diagnosis or believe that no treatments are available to address their symptoms, and (d) concerns about whether the veteran would qualify for services through the Veterans Health Administration ([VHA]; Tanielian et al., 2008; USGAO, 2011). Given the consequences of these barriers (e.g., they serve to prevent veterans from seeking or obtaining treatment), more work needs to be done to reduce their impact on veterans.Telepsychology, or the use of technology to provide mental health services (American Psychological Association, 2013), broadly encompasses a variety of direct formats including videoconferencing, phone, and instant messaging as well as a variety of indirect formats such as email, self-help apps, or websites (Luxton, Nelson, et al., 2016). In this article, telepsychology is more narrowly defined as the use of videoconferencing and telephone technologies to provide mental health services in order to reflect that the bulk of the available research is conducted using one of these two mediums. There are also a number of terms presented in the literature that are interchangeable with the term telepsychology such as telehealth, telemental health, telebehavioral health, teletherapy, telepsychotherapy, etc. (Luxton, Nelson, et al., 2016).Telepsychology is often viewed as a potential solution for increasing access to treatment, increasing privacy, and reducing exposure to the negative stigma associated with seeking treatment for veterans (Chen et al., 2019 [videoconferencing]; Turgoose et al., 2018 [videoconferencing and phone]). For example, telepsychology can allow veterans to use an internet-connected device, such as a computer, in the comfort of their own home or in a local office setting to meet with their provider who may be located across the country by videoconference or phone. Participating in telepsychology increases privacy associated with seeking mental health services by eliminating the need to sit in a lobby with other veterans while waiting for a mental health provider appointment. Furthermore, this increased privacy associated with telepsychology visits can help prevent some of the negative stigma or embarrassment that veterans might experience during face-to-face (FTF) visits by allowing them to avoid those in-office contacts.Effectiveness of TelepsychologyOne question that must be presented to mental health providers and researchers is whether veteran-focused telepsychology is at least as effective as treatment that is delivered FTF (Bolton & Dorstyn, 2015 [videoconferencing]; Turgoose et al., 2018 [videoconferencing and phone]). A growing number of studies have examined this question with some studies finding that telepsychology is effective and equivalent to services delivered FTF, whereas other studies have found mixed results (Turgoose et al., 2018 [videoconferencing and phone]). Telepsychology has generally been found to be an effective treatment delivery method for common mental health conditions experienced by veterans (Bolton & Dorstyn, 2015 [videoconferencing]; Turgoose et al., 2018 [videoconferencing and phone]) including the following: PTSD and other trauma and stressor-related disorders (Wierwille et al., 2016 [videoconferencing]), anxiety (Burke et al., 2019 [internet-delivered]; Yuen et al., 2013 [videoconferencing]), depression (Sztein et al., 2018 [internet-only]), intermittent explosive disorder (Osma et al., 2016 [videoconferencing]), substance use disorders (Wilks et al., 2017 [internet-only]), etc.For example, Wierwille et al. (2016) reported clinically significant reductions in trauma-related symptom in a sample of 221 veterans with PTSD after videoconferencing-delivered exposure therapy at posttest. In another study by Luxton, Pruitt, et al. (2016), 121 military service members and veterans were randomly assigned to receive 8 sessions of behavioral activation therapy for depression either through home-based videoconferencing or FTF visits. At posttest, both the home-based telepsychology and FTF participants demonstrated strong reductions in symptoms of depression and hopelessness, with the home-based group demonstrating a slight overall benefit. Veterans reported statistically significant, high satisfaction ratings suggesting that they were satisfied with treatment, regardless of whether the services were provided through home-based videoconferencing or FTF (Luxton, Nelson, et al., 2016).As the volume of telepsychology research has grown, review studies have been better able to answer the question of whether telepsychology is as effective as FTF services by examining findings from groups of studies that looked broadly at civilian samples (see Bolton & Dorstyn, 2015 [videoconferencing]; Sztein et al., 2018 [internet-only]; Turgoose et al., 2018 [videoconferencing and phone]). For example, Sztein et al. (2018) conducted a civilian-focused systematic review and meta-analysis with 14 studies that examined treatment outcomes for telepsychology-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy for depression. The authors reported a medium effect (d = 0.74; p < .001) at posttest with sustained reductions in symptoms of depression at 3- and 6-month follow-up in adults, which the authors noted were comparable to effect sizes commonly observed in FTF samples (Sztein et al., 2018 [internet-only]). Barak et al.’s (2008) was another civilian-focused meta-analytic study that broadly looked at mental health services provided through telepsychology. The authors reviewed 64 articles that included 9,764 total participants and reported a mean overall medium weighted effect size of d = 0.53 for services delivered through web-based interventions, which the authors noted is also comparable to effect sizes observed in FTF-delivered talk therapies (Barak et al., 2008). Bolton and Dorstyn (2015) looked specifically at the impact of videoconferencing-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy on the symptoms of depression, generalized anxiety, and PTSD in another civilian-focused systematic review. The authors reported significant medium to strong improvements (d range = 0.66–3.22) in symptoms across all conditions in both telepsychology and FTF conditions, but was unable to determine whether telepsychology and FTF-delivered treatments were equivalent (Bolton & Dorstyn, 2015).Our research only noted one review study that focused specifically on veterans. Turgoose et al. (2018) conducted a systematic review that included 41 studies that focused on the use of telepsychology (i.e., videoconferencing and phone) to treat veterans with PTSD. The authors noted that a majority of the studies reviewed found that PTSD treatment delivered by telepsychology was just as effective as PTSD treatments delivered FTF. The authors also noted that veterans participating in telepsychology reported high levels of acceptability and treatment satisfaction overall with services delivered through technology, with some studies suggesting that veterans were less comfortable with services delivered through technology. The authors also noted similar dropout rates for telepsychology and FTF treatments (Turgoose et al., 2018). One limitation of the systematic review, however, is that it is descriptive in nature and looks for trends in the studies reviewed, so it does not allow the author to answer statistical questions such as whether or not services delivered through technology are effective or equivalent to services delivered FTF.The Present StudyResearch on the effectiveness of telepsychology is growing, and both the quantity and quality of veteran-specific studies are expanding (Turgoose et al., 2018). A number of veteran-focused review studies are noted in the literature and those studies have generally found telepsychology to be as effective as services delivered FTF (see Bolton & Dorstyn, 2015; Sztein et al., 2018). Given the unique lived experiences of veterans and the increasing reliance on services delivered via telepsychology, more research is needed to determine whether telepsychology is as effective as services delivered FTF. The Turgoose et al. (2018) systematic review, which focused on PTSD, suggests that services delivered through telepsychology are as effective as services delivered FTF. A new review study, however, is needed to statistically evaluate the effectiveness of services provided by telepsychology for veterans. The present study seeks to add to the literature on the efficacy of telepsychology with veterans by using meta-analytic techniques to test whether telepsychology-based services are effective and whether they are equivalent to services delivered FTF. Furthermore, as technological methods of delivering therapy have evolved, the present study also seeks to examine the differences in the effectiveness of therapy delivered by videoconferencing versus phone.MethodResearch QuestionThe overall research question for this meta-analysis is “Is telepsychology effective for veteran populations?” There are three approaches to answering this question. First, is telepsychology effective across time when comparing pretest assessments to posttest and follow-up assessments? Second, is telepsychology effective compared to treatments as usual (TAU)? Furthermore, are there any differences between the two primary modalities of telepsychology, videoconferencing and phone?Inclusion and Exclusion CriteriaInitially, we broadly defined telepsychology as including mental health services delivered using technology. After reviewing the available literature, we elected to limit the telepsychology modality considered for inclusion in this study to synchronous videoconferencing and telephone. The literature on areas such as instant messaging, email, web apps, etc. with our focus population was too sparse and did not allow for a robust enough sample to be considered for inclusion.We defined veterans as former service members at the time the study was completed. We included studies that contained veterans and that met our other search criteria. Other inclusion criteria included empirical studies that reported findings of a therapeutic intervention delivered by videoconference or telephone. The intervention had to focus on delivering therapy to treat a psychological condition, as opposed to other purposes like screening, testing, assessing, or monitoring. The intervention also had to have a therapeutic component (e.g., reducing symptoms of depression) as opposed to being solely educational in nature. The most common conditions assessed in these studies were PTSD, depression, anger, and anxiety, although therapy for pain, quality of life, relationship satisfaction, sleep quality, hopelessness, overall mental health, psychological functioning, and smoking cessation were also present. Finally, the study had to report clinical outcomes of a psychological nature that included both a pretest and posttest data collection period. We excluded outcomes concerning feasibility, perceptions, satisfaction, and costs.Literature SearchThe research team initially looked for meta-analytic, systematic, and literature review studies for veteran samples to determine the types of review studies that had previously been completed. Then, we searched the reference lists of those articles for empirical studies that met our inclusion criteria. After we exhausted all review studies and their reference lists, the research team conducted a broader literature search using various combinations of the following search terms in the PsycInfo, MedLine, and CINAHL databases: telepsychology, telehealth, telemental health, telebehavioral health, teletherapy, telecounseling, tele, phone, videoconferencing, therapy, counseling, psychotherapy, veterans, treatment, disorder, and mental health. We continued this process of searching databases and back-searching reference lists until we were confident all of the relevant published studies had been located.Computing Effect SizesPractically, all outcome measures in this set of studies were scored such that higher values indicated worse psychological conditions and lower values indicated better psychological conditions. For example, high scores on the PTSD Checklist (PCL), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS), Symptom Checklist-90-Revised (SCL), Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ), etc. represent higher levels of psychological distress, so therapies that lower scores on these measures have desirable effects. Typically, these situations result in negative effect sizes (i.e., the posttest scores are lower than the pretest scores). However, we have reported positive effect sizes to reflect that psychological conditions improved as a result of the therapy.There were a few measures wherein higher values indicate better psychological conditions (e.g., QOLI, relationship quality, and satisfaction). We used positive effect sizes to indicate improvement in psychological conditions for these measures.Although some very good work has been done in developing appropriate metrics for meta-analyses, the data presented in the studies we reviewed do not permit that good work to be fully capitalized upon. Nearly all of the studies that were located reported pre–post comparisons, and the effect size for pre–post comparisons is the mean change score divided by the standard deviation of the change scores. Only one article reported these data (Fortney et al., 2015).More commonly, the articles reported the mean pre and postscores for the treatment group (and often a comparison group), and they reported the standard deviation for the pretest scores and the standard deviation for the posttest scores. Note that the standard deviation of the change scores is not simply the difference between the standard deviations of the pretest and posttest scores, nor is it the average of the standard deviations of the pretest and posttest scores.Pre–Post Effect SizeBecause this was the only data provided, we made use of it by computing the pre–post effect size (which can also be called the “within group effect size” or the “uncontrolled effect size”) by dividing the difference in pretest and posttest mean scores by the average standard deviation of the pretest and posttest scores.Randomized Clinical Trials Effect SizeSome studies used a true randomized clinical trial (RCT) design to allow for the testing of noninferiority or equivalence of telepsychology to the same therapy-administered FTF. In these designs, one group received therapy administered through telepsychology and a comparison group received the same therapy administered in a FTF format (the TAU group).To compute the effect size for these research designs, we computed a pre–post effect size for both the telepsychology group and the TAU group, and then, we subtracted the TAU group pre–post effect size from the telepsychology group pre–post effect size.Multiple Effect Sizes From StudiesOf the 27 studies, 22 of them reported results for more than one psychological outcome (e.g., Acierno et al., 2016, reported results using both the Beck Depression Inventory, which we categorized as depression, and the Patient Checklist, which we categorized as trauma). Because we analyzed the data by psychological outcome, each study could be included in the results more than once (e.g., the Acierno et al., 2016, study contributed an effect size for both trauma and depression). However, eight studies included two measures for the same psychological outcome (e.g., Aburizik et al., 2013, included both the Patient Health Questionnaire and the Beck Depression Inventory, both of which we categorized as measures of depression). In these cases, the effect sizes for the two measures of the same construct were averaged together before being included in the weighted average calculations. By doing this, we avoided the problem of double-counting these studies.Computing Weighted Average Effect SizesThe goal of meta-analysis is to determine the weighted average effect size for groups of studies that meet certain conditions. However, the process for computing the weighted average effect size differs slightly for the pre–post effect size compared to RCT designs.For pre–post effect sizes, the effect size from each study was weighted by the number of participants who completed the posttest.For the RCT designs, the effect size of each study was weighted by the inverse of the variance of the estimate. The inverse of the variance is highly dependent on the sample size, but it has better psychometric properties than simply using the sample size of each study.Pre–Post and Follow-Up DesignsAll of the studies included in this meta-analysis used at least a pre–post design such that measures of psychological states were collected twice. Many of the studies also included some sort of follow-up measurement after the posttest administration. The most common follow-up measurements were at 3 and 6 months after the posttest.In addition to computing the effect sizes for the pre–post comparisons, we also computed effect sizes for follow-ups when the data were provided in the article. The procedure for computing the follow-up effect sizes was exactly the same as the pre–post effect size, except that instead of using the posttest mean values and standard deviations, the follow-up mean values and standard deviations were used.ResultsDescriptive Results of Literature SearchA total of 27 published studies were located that met the inclusion criteria, and they contained 27 samples (see Table 1TABLES AND FIGUREStable/figure thumbnailTable 1. Description of Studies Included in the Meta-Analysis Organized by Author and Dependent Variable StudiedView larger image > in this page > in new window> Download slidefor a summary of the 27 studies included in the analysis organized by author last name and dependent variable studied). Of these 27 studies, 25 provided pre–post data, and 18 were RCT designs. (Of the seven pre–post studies, three also included a no-treatment wait-list control group, but the wait-list data were not considered.) Of the 27 studies, 19 of them examined more than one psychological outcome measure.Computing the number of participants in these studies was challenging. Not surprisingly, when therapy is being administered over the course of weeks and months, dropout from the studies is a problem. Sample sizes for pretest data were often greater than that for the posttest and follow-up data. Where reported, we used the sample size for the number of participants who were assessed at the posttest or follow-up measurements (see Table 1). The 30 samples used a total of 1,667 participants who received telepsychology (e.g., videoconferencing or telephone) and 981 participants who received FTF therapy in RCT designs.Publication Bias AssessmentPublication bias is a concern in meta-analysis because it is possible that only studies that show strong effects get published. When the conclusions of meta-analytic studies are based only on the studies with strong effect sizes, the outcome of the meta-analysis is biased.There is no definitive method for assessing publication bias, and there is also no definitive procedure for correcting for it. Of the assessments that have been developed, all have limitations (van Aert et al., 2019). However, one general assessment of publication bias is to compute the correlation between sample size and effect size. If this correlation is significant and negative, a tentative inference is that smaller studies are only published when they have stronger effects, resulting in bias in the meta-analytic conclusions.We computed the correlations between sample size and effect size for RCT designs measuring trauma and depression at posttest. These correlations are r = −.17 and .11 for k = 13 and 12 studies, p = .58 and.73, respectively.Similarly, we computed the correlations between sample size and effect size for all of the pre–post effect sizes for both trauma and depression. These correlations are r = −.34 and −.20 for k = 17 and 17 studies, p = .19 and .44, respectively.Although these nonsignificant correlations do not establish that there is no bias in our results, they are an indication that publication bias is not likely to be a strong influence. For psychological conditions other than trauma and depression, and for follow-up assessment months after the posttest, there were simply not enough effect sizes to make it meaningful to compute the correlations.Results of Meta-AnalysisRecall that we examined two different designs: pre–post and RCT. Most of the RCT designs also provided data that could be analyzed for pre–post analyses. To interpret the weighted average effect sizes, we used the guidelines suggested by Cohen (1988) wherein effect sizes in the range of 0.20, 0.50, and 0.80 are considered weak, moderate, and strong effects, respectively.For the pre–post designs, the results for each type of psychological problem are reported in Table 2,TABLES AND FIGUREStable/figure thumbnailTable 2. Summary Statistics for Various Mental Health Conditions in Meta-Analysis at Posttest, and 3- and 6-Month Following Treatment for Pre–Post StudiesView larger image > in this page > in new window> Download slidewhich shows the number of studies, the total number of participants in those studies, the weighted average effect size, and whether the study involved videoconferencing or phone. These results show the effect of telepsychology over time, without regards to any comparison group. Most of the effect sizes are in the moderate-to-strong range, and given that most of them are positive numbers, this result indicates that participants’ psychological well-being improved as a result of receiving services through telepsychology.For example, the two psychological conditions studied most frequently were trauma and depression. We used the guidelines suggested by Cohen (1988) to interpret the weighted average effect sizes. The average weighted effect sizes for trauma (d = 1.00 for videoconferencing and d = 0.51 for phone) and depression (d = 0.86 for videoconferencing and d = 0.44 for phone) across these studies fell into the moderate-to-strong range, and the positive values of the effect sizes indicate that participants’ psychological symptoms of trauma and depression improved from pretest to posttest. It is important to note that this is just improvement over time in the participants, and in this type of research design, there is no control or comparison group. Note that there is no way to compute the confidence intervals for these values because the formula for the confidence intervals depends on having the standard deviation of the difference scores, and this information has not been reported in the studies we located for this meta-analysis.For RCT designs, the results for each type of psychological problem are reported in Table 3,TABLES AND FIGUREStable/figure thumbnailTable 3. Summary Statistics for Various Mental Health Conditions in Meta-Analysis at Posttest and at 3- and 6-Month Following Treatment for Randomized Controlled Trial StudiesView larger image > in this page > in new window> Download slidewhich shows the number of studies, the total number of participants in those studies, the weighted average effect size, the 95% confidence interval for the weighted average effect size, and whether the study involved videoconferencing or phone. These results show the effect of telepsychology over time when compared to an equivalent FTF therapy. Strictly speaking, these are the results of the highest scientific value. Paradoxically, values close to 0.00 are a good thing; they indicate that telepsychology was as effective as services provided FTF. Positive values indicate that telepsychology was more effective than FTF therapy, and correspondingly, negative values indicate that FTF therapy was more effective than telepsychology.For example, consider the values for RCT studies for trauma and depression shown in Table 3. The weighted average effect sizes for trauma are d = −0.25 for videoconferencing and d = −0.34 for phone. The negative sign indicates that participants in the FTF condition improved over time more than those in the telepsychology condition. However, this is a small effect, and thus, it could be practically interpreted as telepsychology is comparably as effective as FTF treatment. Similarly, for depression, the weighted average effect sizes are d = 0.00 for videoconferencing and d = −0.09 for phone. Again, the negative sign indicates that the FTF group fared better than the telepsychology group. But, here again, the effect is very small; it is quite close to 0.00. For practical purposes, telepsychology was equivalent to FTF treatment.DiscussionOverall, the results of this meta-analysis suggest that telepsychology is comparable to FTF therapy for veterans dealing with a variety of psychological conditions. The pre–post comparisons suggest that videoconferencing-based telepsychology has moderate-to-strong effect sizes and telephone-based telepsychology has moderate effect sizes for the two psychological conditions studied most frequently (e.g., trauma and depression).The RCT designs allow for a more powerful conclusion to be drawn. In general, videoconferencing- and telephone-based telepsychology is practically equivalent to and FTF-delivered therapies. The effect sizes comparing telepsychology to FTF therapies are generally weak, indicating that there is little difference in the two modalities.ImplicationsThe present study is also unique in that it compared the two most frequently utilized modes of telepsychology, videoconferencing, and phone. It also extends the work of Turgoose et al. (2018) who described the literature on the effectiveness and equivalence of telepsychology on veterans and adds to the larger body of meta-analytic studies on the effectiveness and equivalence of telepsychology when compared to FTF treatment by applying the meta-analytic approach to veteran-related studies. Turgoose et al.’s (2018) systematic review noted that a majority of veteran-focused studies have found telepsychology to be an effective way of reducing psychological symptoms. That study also indicated that most studies have found that talk therapies delivered to veterans by telepsychology are as effective at reducing mental health symptoms as services that are delivered FTF (Turgoose et al., 2018). Our study extends Turgoose et al.’s findings by using meta-analytic techniques to quantitatively assess and subsequently support their conclusions related to the effectiveness and equivalence of telepsychology. In addition, to our knowledge, our study represents the first meta-analytic study to evaluate the effectiveness and equivalence of telepsychology at reducing mental health symptoms exclusively in veteran samples.In our study, we found that services delivered by telepsychology had a moderate-to-strong effect of reducing symptoms of PTSD and depression in veterans. This finding is similar to the effect sizes reported by other authors who have looked more broadly at the effect sizes of telepsychology for PTSD and depression (Bolton & Dorstyn, 2015; Coughtrey & Pistrang, 2018; Olthuis et al., 2016; Osenbach et al., 2013). For example, Bolton and Dorstyn (2015) reported findings that were similar to ours. Those authors found moderate-to-strong effects (d range = 0.66–3.22) for reductions in cognitive and behavioral symptoms of PTSD, depression, and generalized anxiety in a meta-analysis that included 11 studies and 474 total participants (Bolton & Dorstyn, 2015). Olthuis et al. (2016) reported similar effects for telepsychology for PTSD, d = 0.81. Collectively, these studies suggest that telepsychology-delivered services are an effective way of reducing symptoms of PTSD and depression.Our findings related to the equivalence of telepsychology compared to services delivered FTF with veterans was also comparable to that noted in previous research (Norwood et al., 2018; Osenbach et al., 2013). In the present study, we found services delivered via telepsychology to be equivalent to services delivered FTF (d range = −0.48 to 0.24). Norwood et al. (2018) reported a similar value of d of −0.03 when examining the noninferiority of telepsychology at reducing target mental health symptoms. And Osenbach et al. (2013) reported a d of −0.11 when comparing telepsychology to FTF treatments and a d of 0.29 when comparing telepsychology to TAU comparison groups.LimitationsTwo limitations are noted for the present study, as well as three limitations for the larger body of literature we reviewed. First, in the present study, we were able to locate a sufficient number of studies to assess the effectiveness as well as the equivalence of telepsychology versus FTF for PTSD and depression, especially at posttest for the pre–post and RCT studies (ranged from 12 to 17 studies per analysis). However, the number of studies available to us that examined other diagnostic conditions (e.g., anxiety, pain, sleep disorders, etc.) was minimal. We considered removing any analysis of those diagnostic conditions from our study; however, we elected to include them for documentation purposes to highlight what is currently known. Ideally, we would have a minimum of five studies for each diagnostic condition; we were simply unable to find enough studies for all of the conditions.Second, in the present study, just as we were only able to find a limited number of studies for all of the diagnostic conditions, studies with longitudinal data were limited. For example, we were able to locate 13 RCT studies that provided results at posttest for PTSD; however, only 4 of those studies provided 3-month follow-up data, and only 2 of those studies provided 6-month follow-up data. This lack of longitudinal data on the effectiveness of telepsychology for each of the diagnostic conditions means that our findings reported effect sizes for 3- and 6-month follow-up that are based on limited data. Ideally, our analysis would include a minimum of five studies for each diagnostic condition at 3- and 6-month follow-up.We also noted three limitations related to our review of the larger body of veteran-focused telepsychology literature. First, more RCTs are needed for all diagnostic conditions, especially for diagnostic conditions other than PTSD and depression. For example, we noted no RCTs that targeted substance use disorders and only one or two studies that addressed symptoms of anxiety or pain. To some extent, this makes sense because PTSD and depression are two of the most common mental health problems that veterans experience. However, veterans face a number of mental health problems that telepsychology might be helpful in addressing.Second, very few of the veteran-focused telepsychology studies we identified provided demographic or outcome data on the race, gender, or geographic makeup of their participants. These data could be helpful in determining whether traditionally underserved veteran subpopulations, such as rural, women, and/or veterans of color populations, for example, are experiencing similar levels of efficacy compared to the average participant.Finally, we noted few veteran-focused telepsychology studies that used samples outside of North America, and especially the United States. Are telepsychology-delivered services as effective as, and are those services equivalent to FTF-delivered treatments that are provided to veterans in other areas of the world?Future DirectionsBased on the limitations noted above, both for the present study as well as the larger body of telepsychology-focused research, we offer six suggestions for the future research. First, more studies, especially RCTs that look at diagnostic conditions other than PTSD and depression, are needed. Individual studies in the larger body of telepsychology literature (i.e., veteran and all other populations) have looked at the efficacy of telepsychology for psychological disorders ranging from substance use disorders, anxiety, and obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) to more chronic forms of mental illness including bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. Similar or enhanced versions of these studies should be considered for veterans. Second, future studies should include more follow-up data on research participants. In the present study, follow-up data were most commonly presented at posttest and then at 3- and 6-month posttreatment. Future studies that include this type of follow-up data would allow us to better understand the long-term efficacy of telepsychology with veterans. Third, future studies should include technology modality as a moderator variable to allow us to better understand whether specific types of telepsychology-based services (e.g., videoconferencing vs. telephone) are more effective with veterans than other modalities.Fourth, too few veteran-focused studies related to web apps, email, computer-only, and text messaging or instant chat to consider adding them to the present study. As this body of literature expands, more work needs to be done to better understand the role of these other, less often researched modalities of telepsychology to verify whether and/or under what circumstances these other technologies can be effective methods of providing services using meta-analytic techniques. Fifth, more effort needs to be made to describe sample characteristics such as the race, gender, and geographic location of veteran research participants as well as outcome data on specific veteran subpopulations (e.g., veterans of color). Including these sample characteristics and providing outcome data on these special populations will help future researchers better assess whether the benefits of telepsychology are being experienced by all veterans. Finally, the future research should focus on studying the efficacy of veteran populations outside of North America. Generally, more work must be done to close the gap between veterans who need mental health services and those who receive these services. The present study suggests that telepsychology, especially videoconferencing, and phone whenever videoconferencing is not available, can play an important role in addressing mental health service disparities for veterans. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the child custody evaluation (CCE) community has been astounding and immediate. In March, April, and May of 2020, state and local governments and courts began issuing safe-at-home and social distancing proclamations. Provision of in-person mental health services was discouraged as unsafe (Chenneville & Schwartz-Mette, 2020). These pronouncements required evaluators to quickly learn what technology could be used and how to use it to finish incomplete evaluations or meet the demands of court orders for new evaluations. While the capability of providing behavioral health services with telecommunication technologies has been extended to virtually all clinical aspects of behavioral and mental health practice, such as assessment, consultation, psychoeducation, and treatment (Luxton, Nelson, & Maheu, 2016), utilizing these technologies in parenting plan evaluations had not been a serious topic prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. That has changed. This article examines the feasibility of remote child custody evaluations (RCCEs) both during the pandemic and beyond.The COVID-19 pandemic has pushed an entire professional community to consider whether videoconferencing (VC) can be paired with custody methods and procedures to produce valid, reliable, and trustworthy results. For each component methodology of a comprehensive CCE that would usually require in-person contact, the best practices for using VC and the available empirical research are used to illustrate when VC is acceptable and when it is not. In a completely remote CCE, VC is used to conduct interviews of the adults and children, to conduct psychological testing (to the extent possible), and to conduct parent–child observations. RCCEs retain elements of in-person CCEs such as document retrieval and review and contacts with third-party collaterals—usually by telephone. In order to conduct an RCCE, an evaluator must be competent in both VC use in a professional relationship and in the methodological demands of properly conducting a CCE. However, not every task can be delivered via VC, not every case is appropriate for remote evaluation, not every party or child will agree to using the technology, and not every evaluator will embrace this new approach. Yet progress in a professional specialty like child custody, that looks to science for guidance, is often about generalizations where conclusions obtained in a laboratory or slightly alternative setting are developed, then transported and applied elsewhere in environments that may differ from that in the laboratory or alternative setting (Pearl & Bareinboim, 2014). This is an opportunity to do just that.This effort is not an attempt to fundamentally alter current CCE processes but to extrapolate and accept the lessons learned about VC use in other areas of psychology in the CCE context. Using VC can enable RCCEs to be viewed as an alternative with an array of possible applications, including situations where COVID-19 or other issues require social distancing, as well as situations where other factors (e.g., access to justice, financial considerations, and resource availability) otherwise limit the choices available to families and the court. It is also possible that a family could choose to have their evaluation conducted remotely using VC for reasons entirely their own.These issues are of interest to evaluators making decisions about whether to use VC and to conduct RCCEs. These issues are of interest to attorneys as they advise and represent their clients in various contexts including but not limited to litigation. These issues are also of interest to courts and judges who must decide whether an RCCE will help the court, under what circumstances this approach may or may not work, and how to weigh the data generated via VC. Finally, these issues are also of interest to the parties—and ultimately their children—as they weigh the considerations and factors associated with various dispute resolution alternatives and, when necessary, their access to the authority of the court for problem solving.A Conceptual Model for RCCEsChild custody evaluation may be the most complex and difficult type of forensic evaluation. In contrast to most examinations in which one person is evaluated, in the typical child custody evaluation, the mental health professional examines a number of persons (e.g., mother, father, child or children, and potential or actual stepparents). Additionally, given the expansive nature of the underlying psycholegal issues (i.e., the best interests of the children and the ability of the parents to meet those interests), the examinees must be assessed regarding a variety of behaviors, capacities, and needs. Finally, because the stakes are so significant (i.e., residential placement of the children and decision-making authority with respect to their welfare), emotions in cases of contested custody typically run high, further compounding what is an already complicated evaluation process. (Otto, Edens, & Barcus, 2000, pp. 312–313)Competent child custody evaluators, both those conducting in-person CCEs as well as those performing RCCEs, must operationalize the best interests task and objectives, understand how multiple methods are used to gather data on factors and psycholegal questions, and know how to use the multitrait-multimethod matrix interpretation principles of data analysis. The behaviors of the parties and their children and their relationships usually have multiple determinants. There may be few, if any, linear or simple cause-and-effect relationships.Complex custody disputes almost always involve not just one theory or question but multiple questions and competing theories about highly disputed facts (Dale & Gould, 2014). For the evaluator, these factual disputes require formulating, hypothesizing, and developing opinions to numerous series of questions that are often subsumed under multiple main questions.Determining what is in the best interests of the child involves answering numerous subquestions about child factors, interfamilial and parenting factors, parent factors, and extrafamilial factors (citation omitted). Each of these factors is composed of subfactors that address separate factual questions about how the age of the child, the child’s gender, and the child’s cognitive and emotional development will affect current and future parent–child interactions and functioning (Krauss & Sales, 1999, p. 96).In addition, evaluators must recognize any CCE is an assessment of multiple moving targets; people, their circumstances, and their situations may be in a constant state of change in response to the separation or other aspects of the ongoing dispute. Articulating a conceptual lens is necessary because of how much the evaluator must adapt the methodological elements as the evaluation proceeds. The evaluator manages a process that must assess and investigate required topics, be responsive to opportunities for additional details—which may emerge at any point in the process—and adjust inquiries as the data confirms or disconfirms various hypotheses.The process of any evaluation, whether conducted in person or via VC, is dependent upon a perpetual adaptation of the evaluator’s ability to operationalize best interests considerations and questions, the evaluator’s competence in the use of each of the multiple methods of data collection, and the evaluator’s ability to integrate large amounts of data into a comprehensive understanding of the issues in the case. While there are scientific principles to guide portions of the work, a CCE is still a fact-intensive inquiry and investigation using multiple methods to seek an individualized answer. Diligently applying the conceptual model, the multitrait-multimethod data analysis, and the investigative mindset is the evaluator’s best defense against missing something, against challenges of possible biases, or against performing a less than adequate evaluation.Scope of a CCE: Best Interests Factors and Case-Specific Psycholegal QuestionsIn CCEs, evaluators collect data and facts that are used to develop opinions about relevant factors or psycholegal questions, including opinions about the ultimate issues of custody, residency, and parenting time. In making a best interests determination, courts must consider all the factors that may be identified by statute or case law, as well as any relevant factors raised by the parties. If offering an opinion on the ultimate issues of custody and parenting time, evaluators are also expected to consider these factors, and when possible and appropriate, evaluators may use social science research to support their choice of methods, inferences, and opinions.Evaluators are also encouraged to develop case-specific psycholegal questions to guide their inquiry. “The relevance of the information gathered in the evaluation is directly tied to the clarity and scope of the questions that guide the investigation” (Gould & Martindale, 2009, p. 1). “Clearly defined questions lead the evaluator to choose methods of assessment that measure behaviors directly relevant to questions of concern to the court” (Gould & Martindale, 2007, p. 101). By including specific questions in court orders or stipulations, judges and attorneys increase the likelihood that evaluators will stay on course, investigate the issues of concern, and, in preparing their reports, provide information that bears directly upon the issues before the court (Gould & Martindale, 2009). This process requires considerable pre-evaluation preparation.Child custody evaluators are often asked to evaluate allegations of risky and/or abusive behaviors such as domestic or intimate partner violence, child sexual abuse, various forms of child maltreatment, or claims of parental alienation or alienated children, as well as a multitude of other behaviors believed to place children at risk for harm, neglect, or adjustment problems. Efforts to assess the historical truth of an allegation, for example, usually involve interviewing all of the involved parties and combining this data with information from relevant records or information from other third-party informants.Multiple Methods of Data Collection: Five Types of Data CollectionIn conducting comprehensive child custody evaluations, evaluators apply theory, research, and scientific methodology (Drozd, Oleson, & Saini, 2013). Evaluators seek information from five types of independent data sources: (a) document or record review; (b) interviews, including individual interviews of the parties and, when appropriate, the children, as well as joint and group interviews, when appropriate; (c) psychological testing; (d) direct observations of parent–child relationships via home or office visits; and (e) contacts with collateral sources or witnesses. VC can be used to collect information from several of these data sources, including interviews, observations, and, in some instances, psychological testing.Before proceeding, it is important to recognize that agreement about these types of data collection does not always translate into agreement about the actual methodologies that are used. Different evaluators collect different data, and different evaluators may assign different weight to data (Gould, Kirkpatrick, Austin, & Martindale, 2004, p. 39). Some evaluators may rely differently on different portions of the evaluation in developing their hypotheses and opinions. For example, nonpsychologists are less likely to include psychological testing in their evaluation procedures. These evaluators must answer the same questions but may use records, interviews, observations, and contacts with collaterals to address the questions for which a psychologist uses testing. Evaluators unable to effectively use one methodology (e.g., testing) will be expected to develop ways to investigate issues using tools within their competence. The shortcomings of any individual data collection tool require the evaluator to design methods of investigating the relevant issue in other ways. The evaluator’s approach throughout the evaluation process involves choices. For each important issue or data point, does the evaluator immediately query and follow up or accept an answer in order to move on? Does the evaluator compare data or a fact to a claim or hypothesis and again query and challenge, or do they accept and move on?Conducting in-person interviews, observations, or psychological testing does not guarantee that the evaluator will produce a valid, reliable, or trustworthy work product. Poorly conducted interviews, psychological testing, or observations will likely result in unreliable results. In fact, there often exists as much disagreement as agreement about how each of these methods should be used in evaluations that are conducted in person. Evaluators may differ on how much historical data they collect or on how to weigh this information. With respect to interview techniques, for example, there may be agreement concerning the essential objectives of interviews with parents and with children, but there are disagreements about the degree that these interviews should be structured, with some claiming superiority of structured or semistructured interviews over unstructured interviews (Martindale & Gould, 2004). While many trumpet the importance of parent–child observations, there is no agreed-upon technique or procedure for how to do these observations in CCEs, a fact that raises serious questions about the ecological validity of any inferences based upon any individual evaluator’s parent–child observation procedures (Saini & Polak, 2014). In addition, in response to claims about the inappropriate use of psychological testing in CCEs, the response of a group of evaluators acknowledged problems yet outlined how properly conducted psychological testing can make unique, relevant, and reliable contributions in custody disputes (Rappaport, Gould, & Dale, 2018).The record keeping of evaluators can become an issue. Some have claimed forensic evaluators have a heightened duty to document their work. Some evaluators take copious notes, while others contemporaneously type questions and answers into a computer during interviews. Some evaluators audio record interviews, and others do not. Currently, evaluators who choose to record must have written permission of the parties. It is unclear, however, whether the parents could provide permission for the evaluator to record a child or whether an attorney or some other kind of representative would be needed to assist a child in making the decision about consent to the evaluator recording such contacts. While the forensic interviews of small children in child protection cases are routinely video and audio recorded, this is not standard practice in CCEs. In other areas of the law, evaluators have generally not been required to record forensic interviews without a showing of exception circumstances (see Holland v. United States, 1988 for a review of the case law regarding this issue in Rule 35 examinations). In addition, in order to avoid unequal treatment of evaluators, any requirement to record RCCEs would probably require that all CCEs, including face-to-face evaluations, be recorded. For a myriad of reasons that are beyond the scope of this article, we view such a proposition as highly unlikely.The Multitrait-Multimethod Matrix: Data Analysis and InterpretationIn managing their data collection, constructing hypotheses, and developing conclusions or opinions about the factors and psycholegal questions, evaluators have applied the multitrait-multimethod matrix, triangulation strategies, and the concepts of convergent and discriminant validity. In CCEs (and RCCEs), the multitrait-multimethod matrix refers to use of multiple data collection methods and a process for analyzing the data (Campbell & Fiske, 1959). This method recognizes that the behaviors and competencies of individuals are multiply determined (Wälder, 1936) and that the study of complex phenomena requires an active process of developing possible hypotheses and inferences from an evolving data set. Within this process, evaluators seek to avoid bias by maintaining even hovering attention to these multiple hypotheses (Freud, 1912), remaining vigilant to established methods and protocols that they have established, and adjusting the hypotheses as new data and issues are collected. Any deficiency in data collection in one area can be remedied by additional inquiry or by applying a different methodology to get that information. The multitrait-multimethod approach is the evaluator’s best defense against claims of bias or overreliance on simple answers to complex questions (Neal & Brodsky, 2016).Data analysis strategies using the multitrait-multimethod matrix heavily rely upon triangulation (Austin & Kirkpatrick, 2004). Triangulation involves using more than one approach or more than one data source to study, in this instance, a factor or question. Triangulation enhances reliability and validity by cross-checking or cross-referencing data or by combining different perceptions of the same event to provide a more robust and holistic picture (Vidovich, 2003). Triangulation also includes cross-checking data from multiple methods, sources, theories, and/or data types in order to get a more detailed and balanced picture of the situation (Altrichter, Feldman, Posch, & Somekh, 2008). The term “convergent validation” is used to describe when data from independent procedures support or validate the same conclusion or opinion, and the term “discriminant validation” is used to describe when data from independent procedures fail to support the same conclusions or opinions (Campbell & Fiske, 1959). There also may be times when evaluators must explain seemingly divergent data.CCEs also usually involve one or more hypothesis or theory about the meaning of various facts and events in the case. “Forensic practitioners ordinarily avoid relying solely on one source of data, and corroborate important data whenever feasible” (American Psychological Association [APA], 2013b, p. 15). In addition, while unique facts can be disclosed or discovered during any part of a CCE, there is generally no one-to-one correspondence between any single evaluation methodology and any best interests factor or psycholegal question. This is especially true when evaluating various kinds of competencies (e.g., parenting competence), where data from multiple sources are relevant.Evaluating each hypothesis or theory involves a combination of scientific and clinical thinking (Milchman, 2015). The scientific method calls for testing alternative hypotheses or theories and collecting evidence that confirms or disconfirms either an individual hypothesis or unifying theory. Coherence-based reasoning also applies to the evaluator’s data analyses as one attempts to integrate numerous, complex, and sometimes contradictory inferences into a coherent theory about the case (Charman, Douglass, & Mook, 2019). Understanding the implications of any particular hypothesis or theory and the interrelationships between the data and facts of the case is central to determining whether any fact confirms, disconfirms, supports, or disproves that particular hypothesis or theory.Child custody evaluators attempt to combine two sets of skills that are often presented as opposite extremes: the empirically minded psychometrician and the self-aware clinician. The extremes of this artificial and largely academic debate are captured in the following quote:In psychometric testing the examiner is seen as a source of error or bias, therefore his role is standardized and minimized, if not eliminated. By contrast, in clinical testing the role of the examiner is maximized: the examiner’s skill, judgment, and intuitive sensitivity are not only valued but are also regarded as the most sensitive and perceptive clinical tools available. The variety of interactional reactions that arise in the patient-examiner relationship are neither avoided nor acted upon; rather, they are identified and observed and then used as valuable aids in bringing greater meaning and understanding to the patient’s behavior and attitudes Clinicians should at all times be able to point to the data from which they draw their conclusions and also to trace out explicitly the chain of inferences that led to those conclusions. (Lerner, 1976, p. 7)In sum, each evaluator must design a study of the best interests factors and the psycholegal questions that are relevant to each case. There are both common elements to every CCE and unique, case-specific elements to every CCE. The approach is not totally experimental. Whereas scientific experiments seek to eliminate or minimize experimenter bias through methodological design, the custody evaluator’s task is to manage a dynamic process while remaining balanced, objective, and as free as possible from bias.The Substitutability of VC: Process ConsiderationsDemonstrating the substitutability of VC for face-to-face procedures can be done through comparisons of two interpersonal process variables and two outcome variables. The two process variables central to CCEs are empathic accuracy and the working alliance. The two outcome variables are positive therapy outcome (e.g., task completion) and studies demonstrating the equivalence of telemental health services provided by VC with those provided face to face.Empathic Accuracy and the Primary of Auditory and Visual Behaviors Over Nonverbal CuesMany evaluators are concerned that using VC and conducting RCCEs will result in a reduction in what has been termed “empathic accuracy.” Empathic accuracy is “the ability to perceive accurately how another person is feeling” (Levenson & Ruef, 1992, p. 234). Empathic accuracy is commonly operationalized as the correspondence between the thoughts and feelings people report experiencing and the thoughts and feelings that perceivers infer from the target’s behaviors (Ickes, Bissonnette, Garcia, & Stinson, 1990). Empathic accuracy is a relevant process variable because it is central to effective service delivery in both clinical and forensic psychology. It is an indication of emotional intelligence, and it is a clearly desirable skill for forensic evaluators (Brodsky & Wilson, 2013; Franklin, 2013). Even those with concerns about the uses of expressive empathy by evaluators agree that “empathic understanding” is an important element of forensic assessment (Greenberg & Shuman, 1997, p. 53). Certainly, some level of empathy is necessary for completion of a thorough assessment. While one research study found no significant differences in evaluee disclosures or uses of impression management (e.g., lying) when evaluators actively used expressive empathy versus when evaluators did not use expressive empathy (Vera et al., 2019), evaluators who come across as cold and callous risk discouraging evaluees from being thorough and honest (Franklin, 2013). Many have argued that the internal reaction of forensic evaluators may provide valuable information, if properly used (Erard & Pickar, 2008; Mulay, Mivshek, Kaufman, & Waugh, 2018; Pickar & Erard, 2008).Empathic accuracy generally depends on visual, auditory, and semantic information—a great deal of which is available through a VC interview. While it is certainly true that people express much of their emotion life in nonverbal behavior (Mehrabian, 1970; Mehrabian, 1981), the proper response in a forensic evaluation to potentially relevant nonverbal behavior is verbal inquiry into possible explanations of what has been observed, not interpretations that are uninformed by an appropriate query. The forensic evaluator’s focus on accuracy should lead to follow-up inquiry into observations of potentially relevant nonverbal behavior with the goal of making explicit potentially relevant emotions, their meaning, and their relevance to the legal questions being investigated.Studies have found that verbal and contextual cues have more value than nonverbal cues, a fact that supports the necessity of inquiry into possible emotional states associated with nonverbal cues identified by evaluators. Studies of empathic accuracy as an interpersonal process have explored the types of informational cues (i.e., facial expressions or semantic information) that lead others to be able to “read” their emotional expressions (Zaki, Bolger, & Ochsner, 2009). When contextual information is available, empathy accuracy has been shown to be primarily dependent upon verbal and contextual cues rather than nonverbal cues (Gesn & Ickes, 1999; Zaki et al., 2009). Immediate contextual cues (the verbal and nonverbal behaviors that precede each reported thought or feeling) and the cumulative contextual cues (the emergent meaning context that develops as a function of the temporal nature of an interaction) allow one to infer the specific content of a target person’s successive thoughts and feelings (Gesn & Ickes, 1999). Studies have also found that nonverbal expressive people are more “readable” than nonverbal, nonexpressive people (Zaki et al., 2009). Empathic accuracy increases when perceivers have access to both auditory and visual information rather than only auditory or only visual information (Zaki et al., 2009). In RCCEs, evaluators who observe nonverbal behavior should inquire as to the possible thoughts and emotions that the nonverbal behavior reflects.The desire to actually observe and see all nonverbal behavior is related to concerns about deception and “truth bias.” Truth bias refers to the fact that many individuals believe they can detect deception (Hancock, Woodworth, & Goorha, 2010). Every time new technologies are developed that allow people to communicate at a distance, from the telephone to the telegraph to the invention of the alphabet, the public has registered concerns about increases in lying (see Hancock, 2007). The “cue-availability heuristic” refers to the notion that when there are fewer cues, people might lie more often (Toma & Hancock, 2012). This notion asserts that people might lie more often because there are no nonverbal cues to be detected, and therefore, they are less likely to be discovered than they are in face-to-face interactions (Hancock & Woodworth, 2013). Unfortunately, studies have shown that very few people are good at detecting deceit in interpersonal interactions (Porter, Woodworth, & Birt, 2000). As previously described, inquiry into nonverbal behaviors and the disciplined use of the procedures in the conceptual model are designed to address these concerns to the extent that this is possible.Indeed, one small study of the effects of telepsychology format on empathic accuracy and therapeutic alliance found no significant differences on these variables in a comparison of VC, telephone, and face-to-face psychotherapy (Reese et al., 2016). Because the clients in this study received only one session of psychotherapy, these results must be considered preliminary, but they are encouraging. However, because we view empathy accuracy as a principle component of successful therapy, the evidence for successful teletherapy also should be viewed as evidence that empathy accuracy is possible through VC. This research is reviewed in this article.Working Alliance: Maximizing Data Gathering and Completing the Tasks of the EvaluationThe use of empathy in professional relationships is closely connected to the concept of a working alliance. The use of empathy in forensic evaluations may have varying levels of appropriateness, depending upon the nature of the evaluation and the setting in which the evaluation occurs. To the extent it is realistic, an assessment-based working alliance that fosters openness and acceptance should improve the assessment product (Mulay et al., 2018). While there are differences between the working alliance in therapy and in forensic assessment, we again assert that the research on the effectiveness of telemental health procedures should be viewed as evidence that forming a working alliance through VC is possible and achievable.There may be differences in the working alliance in therapy and the working alliance in CCEs, but there are also numerous similarities. In therapeutic relationships, the working alliance concept includes the emotional bond between the client and therapist, the quality of the client and therapist involvement in the tasks of therapy, and the amount of concordance on goals between the therapist and client (Bordin, 1979). In therapeutic relationships, the working or therapeutic alliance is a central “causal ingredient of change” (Henry, Strupp, Schacht, & Gaston, 1994, p. 485).In studies of the effectiveness of teletherapy that have found positive and equivalent outcomes, it seems safe to assume the therapists were able to develop successful working and therapeutic alliances. The ability for therapists to establish a working alliance via VC was also demonstrated in a study directly comparing the working alliances of the therapy processes and outcomes of clients randomly assigned to face-to-face, telephone, and VC. This study found no differences on either the working alliance or the outcome variables between the clients receiving services in different ways (Day & Schneider, 2002). In addition, this same study also found that client participation was significantly higher in distance modes (e.g., VC and telephone) than when face to face with their therapists. The researchers speculated that clients in the distance modes made more of an effort to communicate, that they took more responsibility for the interaction, or that distance made openness seem safer (Day & Schneider, 2002).The working alliance in a forensic CCE is different, but it still involves developing a working alliance. There is a consensus that forensic evaluators should refrain from developing or creating the impression of a helping or therapeutic relationship. The evaluator’s job is to help the court, but this is impossible to do without attending to and developing the evaluator-examinee relationship enough to achieve the goals of learning each party’s parenting plan proposal and investigating the factors or questions that have been identified for evaluation. Whether one argues against empathy in forensic evaluations in the interest of objectivity (e.g., Shuman, 1993) or for moderate empathy in the interest of objectivity (e.g., Brodsky & Wilson, 2013), evaluations involve gathering information from multiple sources. At a minimum, conveying respect for the other person and behaving in a culturally competent, ethical, polite, and professional manner remains a necessary aspect of any evaluator’s behavior (Brodsky & Wilson, 2013). Evaluators who keep a substantial interpersonal distance may be likely to receive truncated information (Jourard, 1971).A certain level of cooperation is particularly important in RCCEs. Using VC technology for RCCEs is likely a more valid and reliable procedure when the parties agree to its use. Generally, the validity of any psychological assessment is modulated by the degree to which the person being assessed accepts (i.e., is willing to participate in) the context of a given assessment including the setting and the manner in which the assessment is conducted. An individual’s acceptance of a particular type of assessment is a multifaceted construct that depends on an individual’s physical and emotional state, motivation, attention, personality, and temperament (Luxton et al., 2016). Poor acceptance has been cited as a factor that reduces compliance and the motivation to engage in mental health assessments (Rogers, 2001). Inadequate acceptance of telemental health by either the patient or practitioner can therefore be expected to have a negative influence on the validity and reliability of psychological assessments (Luxton, Pruitt, & Osenbach, 2014, p. 28).Some level of cooperation from the parties is necessary to do an RCCE because elements of the evaluation occur in unsupervised settings.Provision of telemental health services in professionally unsupervised settings requires that the patient take a more active and cooperative role in the . . . process than in in-person settings. Determining whether a patient [interviewee, added] can handle such demands may be more dependent on the patient’s organizational and cognitive capacities, than on diagnosis. (Turvey et al., 2013, p. 10)To help assure the validity and reliability of remote assessment, it is necessary to make sure the environmental conditions at the remote location are conducive to the assessment procedures. Ideally, the room would be set up according to the foci of the session (Gloff, LeNoue, Novins, & Myers, 2015, p. 518).Many patients and families report high satisfaction with telemental health. Reasons for this include (a) conveniently finding high-quality services close to home, (b) decreasing time away from both work and school, (c) decreasing costs associated with traveling miles for care, (d) decreasing stresses of travel with a child with a behavior disorder and siblings, (e) decreasing worries about navigating unfamiliar health care settings, (f) allowing additional supporters to attend and work together to coordinate care, and (g) decreasing stigma by connecting to child-friendly settings such as schools (Gloff et al., 2015; Nelson, Cain, & Sharp, 2017). These same dynamics might apply to the participants in RCCEs.The Substitutability of VC: The Empirical Outcome and Equivalence EvidenceThe use of technologies in mental health and psychological practice has steadily increased over the last decade (Luxton et al., 2014) because studies of the technology demonstrate it can be effectively used to achieve positive, equivalent outcomes. The principles and procedures used for psychological assessment and evaluation during treatment services (i.e., diagnosis and symptom assessment) are pertinent to other remote assessment and testing applications including neuropsychological and cognitive testing, forensic risk assessment, and occupational testing (Luxton et al., 2014). This section reviews the evidence base for telemental health procedures across adult and child populations, assessment and treatment tasks, and numerous clinical and forensic conditions. The authors assert that the consistently positive outcomes and demonstrated equivalence found in these studies support the notion that child custody evaluators, like therapists and other clinical and forensic evaluators, can develop empathic accuracy and working alliances sufficient to produce valid, reliable, and trustworthy child custody evaluations for the courts.VC in Psychotherapy With AdultsThe consensus at this point is that there is sufficient data of efficacy of telepsychology and a lack of data that it is inferior that there is no basis for overriding the choice of an informed client and competent therapist that this is an acceptable alternative under the right circumstances. (Harris, 2019, slide number, 47)Numerous reviews of the existing research document the feasibility of using VC in psychotherapy with adults. In a systematic literature review of 65 studies across psychotherapy modalities regarding the use of VC psychotherapy (VCP), 10 questions were addressed, including what therapeutic types/formats have used VC, in what populations VCP has been used, the number and types of publications related to VCP, and available satisfaction, feasibility, and outcome data related to VCP (Backhaus et al., 2012). The results indicate that VCP is feasible, has been used in a variety of therapeutic formats and with diverse populations, is generally associated with good user satisfaction, and is found to have similar clinical outcomes to traditional face-to-face psychotherapy (Backhaus et al., 2012). Another review of 26 studies of VC and cognitive–behavioral therapy concluded that the majority of the studies supported the effectiveness of using VC to deliver psychotherapy (Gros et al., 2013).Recent large randomized controlled trials demonstrate effectiveness of telemental health, with many smaller trials also supporting this conclusion. Regarding specific subgroups, such as patients with psychotic or phobic disorders, one review found no evidence for inferiority of VC telemental health for patients with psychosis (Sharp, Kobak, & Osman, 2011). Another study with psychotic patients compared in-person versus VC interviews and concluded that even patients with delusions pertaining to the TV appropriately responded to VC and did not incorporate their experiences into their delusional system (Dongier, Tempier, Lalinec-Michaud, & Meunier, 1986). A small study comparing in-person versus VC-based treatment for panic disorder with agoraphobia found equal effectiveness (Bouchard et al., 2004).VC in Forensic Settings: Clinical, Civil Commitment, and Competence AssessmentsVC has been used for psychiatric and forensic assessments in corrections environments around the world. In a study of 72 inpatients at a maximum security forensic unit of a state hospital in Washington found good to excellent reliabilities when comparing in-person with VC administrations of the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale-Anchored Version and the MacArthur Competence Assessment Tool-Criminal Adjudication (Lexcen, Hawk, Herrick, & Blank, 2006). A study of 21 forensic psychiatric inpatients comparing live interviews to VC interviews using the Georgia Court Competency Test found high levels of agreement between the interviewers (Manguno-Mire et al., 2007). In a study of 190 youth in juvenile detention, telemental health services were found to be associated with youth attaining goals and improving family relations during their incarceration (Fox, Connor, McCullers, & Waters, 2008).VC has been used to provide forensic opinions in court on mentally disordered offenders in Western Australia (Sullivan, Chapman, & Mullen, 2008) and in involuntary commitment proceedings in rural Australia (Yellowlees, 1997). VC has been used by psychiatrists in the United Kingdom to conduct gate-keeping assessments, prepare psychiatric court reports, and provide courtroom testimony for the criminal and civil courts (Khalifa, Saleem, & Stankard, 2008, pp. 6–8).VC in Neuropsychological AssessmentsMuch of the research on the use of VC in test administration originates in neuropsychology (or what is now termed “teleneuropsychology”; Grosch, Gottlieb, & Cullum, 2011). A meta-analytic review of 12 studies of VC-delivered neuropsychological tests found “support for the use of videoconferencing technology in the remote administration of neuropsychological tests, particularly those that rely upon verbal responses from participants” (Brearly et al., 2017, p. 184).Neuropsychological tests relying upon verbal instructions and responses are particularly well suited to VC administration, and good agreement between VC and face-to-face testing has been found in a number of studies. For example, one study of VC-based neuropsychological assessment versus in-person assessment of subjects with or without cognitive impairment (i.e., dementia) found no significant differences and concluded VC-based neuropsychological testing is a valid and reliable alternative to face-to-face assessment using selected measures (Cullum, Hynan, Grosch, Parikh, & Weiner, 2014). Other research groups comparing clinical diagnostic interviewing conducted via VC and traditional face-to-face conditions has suggested generally good agreement in diagnosing a variety of conditions including dementia (Barton, Morris, Rothlind, & Yaffe, 2011) and Alzheimer’s disease (Loh, Donaldson, Flicker, Maher, & Goldswain, 2007).VC in Remote Psychological Personality Testing: No Research, But New GuidanceThere is currently no known empirical research on remote administration of measures of personality. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, however, test publishers quickly developed methods for remote administration of numerous measures used by evaluators. Tests now available for remote administration include but are not limited to the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) instruments, the Millon inventories, and the Personality Assessment Inventory. For other psychological tests such as the Rorschach, remote administration procedures have also been developed. Remote administration is also possible for instruments like the Behavior Assessment Scale for Children or the Connors Rating Scales, which typically have been given to parents for completion at home.Given these parameters, VC can be used in remote psychological testing in two ways. First, some research investigations, particularly with some of the cognitive and neuropsychological tests that were previously discussed, have demonstrated that psychologists can use VC to administer certain psychological tests. Some but not all psychological tests lend themselves to remote administration. Remote psychological testing also may be possible with the assistance of monitors or proctors who, in partnership with the psychologist, assist in the administration of the test items and tasks.Second, VC can be used to allow a monitor or the psychologist evaluator to monitor test administration. Remote administration of psychological tests must consider the potential impact of remote administration procedures on the validity and reliability of the results (Corey & Ben-Porath, 2020). Therefore, “although these professional practice guidelines provide little practical instruction on how to ensure adherence to applicable ethical standards when administering psychological tests remotely, they do highlight an issue that is fundamental to understanding the challenge in remote psychological testing” (Corey & Ben-Porath, 2020, p. 200). Guideline 7 states,When a psychological test or other assessment procedure is conducted via telepsychology, psychologists are encouraged to ensure that the integrity of the psychometric properties of the test or assessment procedure (e.g., reliability and validity) and the conditions of administration indicated in the test manual are preserved when adapted for use with such technologies. (APA, 2013a, p. 798)The emphasis when using VC is on preserving the conditions of administration outlined in the test manual, whether this is in direct test administration or monitoring of someone completing a self-report instrument. For example, in a section titled “Testing Conditions,” the MMPI-2 manual describes the following:The typical testing situation for administering the MMPI-2 requires adequate space at a table to lay out the test booklet and answer sheet, good lighting, a comfortable chair, and quiet surroundings free of intrusions and distractions. However, it is often not possible to provide an ideal testing environment. For example, the hardcover version makes it possible to take the test in a waiting room or while sitting up in a bed in a hospital ward. In such settings. Precautions must be taken to ensure that the person taking the test is not bothered by others in the room or offered gratuitous advice by fellow patients. It is generally permissible to let the individual take the test in several shorter sessions over a limited period of time, say before or after an interruption for routine procedures. (Butcher et al., 2001, p. 9)A Case Example of Remote MMPI-2 AdministrationIn the initial VC CCE interview between the evaluator, Father (at home in city 60 miles from evaluator), and Mother (at home in city 180 miles from evaluator), the evaluator reviewed the court order and evaluation procedures. The court order included a provision allowing the evaluator to use VC. The parties and their attorneys agreed to this order.After the evaluator’s initial joint interview with Father and Mother conducted via VC (using GoToMeeting, which is HIPAA compatible and securely encrypted), Father and Mother were directed to remain at their respective computers (where there is adequate lighting and a comfortable chair) with no one else around or in the room (e.g., distraction-free environment) to await an e-mail with a link to the portal through which they could complete the psychological testing. On his computer, the evaluator logged onto Pearson Q global and sent Father an e-mail, confirmed Father’s receipt of that e-mail, and confirmed that Father was able to connect to the Pearson website via the link in the e-mail in order to take the test. Father began the test. The evaluator and Mother went through the same procedure until Mother was connected to the Pearson website and taking the test.The evaluator remotely monitored Father and Mother via VC while they were taking the test. The evaluator silenced his audio input and intermittently closed the ability of Father and Mother to see him. However, Father and Mother were prohibited from shutting down their audio or visual inputs. Through this continuous supervision, the evaluator confirmed that Father and Mother took the test without any outside assistance or distractions. At the end of taking the test, Father and Mother each signed off the Pearson portal, and their test responses were sent to Pearson.The evaluator logged onto Pearson again, located the respective test protocols, and generated an MMPI-2 Extended Score Report for each test taker. In order to conduct the critical item review with Father, Mother was excused from the VC connection. She signed off. The evaluator and Father stayed connected, and the evaluator conducted his critical item interview. When this was completed, Father was instructed to sign off and did so. Mother was contacted by cell phone and instructed to sign back on to the conference. When she did, the evaluator completed a critical item interview with her.Telemental Health Evidence Base for Use of VC With Children and AdolescentsToday’s youth comfortably communicate with peers and family members using information and communication technologies such as Skype, WhatsApp, FaceTime, Facebook Messenger, and a host of others (Saini & Polak, 2014). Telemental health may be especially suited for youth who frequently use the technology and may positively respond to the personal space and feeling of control allowed by VC. Videoconferencing may also offer advantages in working with adolescents, including less self-consciousness, increased personal space, and decreased confidentiality concerns as the provider is outside of the local community (Myers et al., 2017).VC Use in Therapy With Children and AdolescentsTo be included as a feasible accommodation in an RCCE, evaluators interviewing children using VC must be able to establish rapport with the child, develop adequate cooperation, and develop an alliance sufficient to gather data and information on a wide variety of topics. Interviews of the children in custody disputes are a central, essential, and often required element of child custody evaluations (Ackerman & Pritzl, 2011; Bow & Quinnell, 2004). There exists a substantial literature on interviewing children in custody cases (Saywitz, Camparo, & Romanoff, 2010; Warshak, 2003). Information from these interviews informs the evaluator on several important issues. State statutes often have several child-related best interests factors that must be considered by the court. These factors include but are not limited to the child’s preferences, the child’s adjustment, and the parent–child relationship. The perspectives of children are also crucial to an assessment of the children’s needs, the parental capacities for meeting these needs, and the resulting fit (APA, 2010). While the use of children as witnesses can stir controversy, their accounts of events in the home or in the life of the family or various family members, as well as accounts of the behaviors of others, can be helpful to understanding various allegations, claims, and stories. While children do not normally expect to make the custody decisions, many children, particularly older children, want to be heard on the issues that affect them (Cashmore & Parkinson, 2008).Support for using VC interviews with children and adolescents in CCEs comes from multiple sources. In 2017, the American Telemedicine Association (ATA) developed the “Practice Guidelines for Telemental Health for Children and Adolescents” (CATMH) regarding use of Internet-based and telephone-based VC. The guidelines focus on interactive VC with the goal of providing the same level of service delivery that is provided in person. CATMH programs involving clinical evaluation and treatments have been successfully implemented in multiple diverse settings such as pediatric clinics (Myers, Sulzbacher, & Melzer, 2004), community mental health centers, rural schools, urban daycare, corrections (Myers, Valentine, & Melzer, 2008), and independent practice (Grady et al., 2011). CATMH has been applied to diverse populations such as African American, Hispanic, Hawaiian, Native American, and Alaska Native youth (Myers et al., 2017).The professional and research literature documents the ability of mental health professional to use VC to successfully fulfill professional roles and complete professional tasks. “Child and adolescent telemental health has been practiced successfully across underserved settings with diverse youth, for most psychiatric disorders, and across development” (Nelson et al., 2017, p. 77). Development of a therapeutic alliance is a robust predictor of positive outcome in mental health treatment and is particularly important when working with children and adolescents.The single most effective means of establishing an alliance with young people is conversation (Gloff et al., 2015). Experienced teleclinicians and preliminary research suggest that clinicians and patients can, and do, establish a therapeutic alliance during telemental health treatments (Goldstein & Glueck, 2016). Satisfaction studies demonstrate the ability to develop a therapeutic alliance with youth and families through telemental health (ATA, 2018). Only occasionally do children and adolescent patients rate alliance, or rapport, as significantly lower for telemental health versus the in-person modality.The feasibility of delivering psychotherapy through VC has been demonstrated for agoraphobia, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, bulimia nervosa, depression, obsessive–compulsive disorder, panic disorder, and posttraumatic stress disorder (Nelson et al., 2017). It also has been shown to be effective in working with children with autism and other developmental disorders (Szeftel, Federico, Hakak, Szeftel, & Jacobson, 2012).VC Use in Forensic Interviews of Children Regarding Possible Child AbuseIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, child protective service agencies across the country have turned to what are being called “tele-forensic interviews” in cases of possible child abuse and neglect. These interviews utilize synchronous VC while interviewing young children in cases involving suspected child abuse, sexual abuse, or neglect. In March 2020, a team from the National Children’s Alliance, Montclair State University, and Central Michigan University developed an extensive protocol for “Emergency Tele-Forensic Guidelines.” These guidelines include detailed instructions for choosing to do the interview as well as how to conduct it (National Children’s Alliance, 2020). In their training webinar, one presenter reported on a yet-to-be published research project comparing interviews conducted by VC with interviews conducted in person. The research involved interviews of 230 children who were 4 to 8 years old using a staged event (e.g., a touching by a male assistant), after which the children were provided misinformation about the event by their parents before being interviewed either face-to-face or by videoconferencing. Preliminary results indicate there were no differences between the accuracy of reports gathered by VC as compared to in-person interviews. There were no differences between true and false reports and no differences with source monitoring problems. While there were age differences showing that younger children were less talkative, there were no indications that children were more suggestible in the VC interviews (National Children’s Alliance, 2020).A separate experimental research project studied the memory reports of 100 children between the ages of 5 and 12 and found that “video-feed interviewing was just as effective as face-to-face interviewing in terms of the accuracy and informativeness of children’s accounts” (Hamilton, Whiting, Brubacher, & Powell, 2016, p. 260). The children were interviewed by experienced interviewers 1 to 2 days after they participated in an innocuous event.VC in Parent–Child Therapy, Parent–Child Observations, and Family TherapyThe central purpose of conducting observations of parent–child interactions is to provide an important source of information for assessing parent–child connections and dynamics, to focus on each parent’s ability to respond to the needs of the child, observe a child’s response to each parent, and to consider potential risks and concerns within the parent–child relationship or contextual factors that may impede or facilitate these relationships. (Saini & Polak, 2014, pp. 185–186)Many are concerned that use of VC for parent–child observations may not be feasible or might yield less helpful or less reliable information than in-person observations. This is already a concern about in-person CCEs. The available research on observations during evaluations shows considerable variability between evaluators, which suggests that evaluators may not be systematically studying the same dimensions of parenting (Saini & Polak, 2014). Whether or not a parent–child observation is valid and reliable depends upon how the task is introduced, how the task is interpreted by the parent and child (or children), and what happens when performing the task.If properly used, it is possible that synchronous VC technology could enhance the ecological validity of the parent–child observations (Comer, Furr, Kerns, et al., 2017). Several studies have found VC as effective as in-person service delivery in addressing parent–child interactions. For example, remotely conducted parent–child interaction therapy (PCIT) has been shown to be feasible and to have comparable outcomes to clinic-based treatments with several small subgroups of children with anxiety-related conditions (such as obsessive–compulsive disorder; Comer, Furr, Kerns, et al., 2017) and externalizing youth (Comer, Furr, Miguel, et al., 2017).In-office PCIT uses real-time, in-session parent coaching where the therapist monitors family interactions from an observation room and provides live, individualized coaching via a parent-worn bug-in-the-ear device (Crum & Comer, 2016, p. 230). Internet PCIT simply changes the location of the therapist from behind a screen in another room to feedback from a remote location through a Bluetooth earpiece. In addition, behavioral parent training for parents and their children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder found similar effectiveness rates among those who received the services online versus those who received services face to face (Dupaul et al., 2017). Obviously, there is a need to adequately capture the parent–child interaction via VC in order for this process to work.In addition, the use of videos for a broad spectrum of consultation, research, and therapy purposes has been well documented. For example, video observations have been central to research on attachment and early parent–infant relationships (Gridley, Bywater, & Hutchings, 2018; Rusconi-Serpa, Sancho Rossignol, & McDonough, 2009; Steele et al., 2014).Logistical problems increase as the number of people in the VC increases. There is no data on family therapy by VC. Critical issues specific to family-based telemental health care include (a) navigating varying levels of technological literacy across generations of participants, (b) deciding which family members to include, (c) ensuring the safety of participant, (d) optimizing therapeutic alliance and engagement of all participants, (e) navigating logistical concerns in conducting sessions, and (f) ensuring privacy (Crum & Comer, 2016). These developments demonstrate that such technological innovations can be used to overcome many traditional barriers to effective care (Comer et al., 2015), but no research on these issues is currently available.The Ethics of Using VC in RCCEsThe practice of telemental health, including VC, involves consideration of ethical standards, legal requirements, telecommunication technologies, and individual practitioner policies and procedures that must be balanced with any other external constraints or demands of the particular professional context (APA, 2013a). The same ethical standards for delivering in-person services apply to professionals providing services using VC. It is the professional’s responsibility to maintain and enhance their level of understanding of their professional ethics, the concepts specific to VC service delivery (APA, 2013a), and to integrate any unique demands using VC might have on their work into their policies, practices, and procedures.The goal of most telemental health services is to approximate the same best practices of in-person service delivery (APA, 2013a). Generally, the same liabilities, risks, and ethical issues encountered during in-person practice apply to telemental health. The APA Telepsychology Task Force provides eight telepsychology-specific guidelines for practitioners (see Table 1;TABLES AND FIGUREStable/figure thumbnailTable 1. Eight Guidelines for Practice of Telepsychology (APA, 2013a)View larger image > in this page > in new window> Download slideAPA, 2013a). These guidelines address issues of competence, standards of care in the delivery of telepsychology services, informed consent, confidentiality of data and information, security and transmission of data and information, disposal of data and information and technologies, testing and assessment, and interjurisdictional practice.However, the geographical distance between the provider and service recipient and the use of technology as the medium of service provision introduce additional risks and considerations that extend beyond those of conventional in-person services (Luxton et al., 2016). In its guidelines for informed consent when using video-based technology, the ATA identified several situation-specific conditions that must be addressed as part of ethical telemental health practice (see Table 2;TABLES AND FIGUREStable/figure thumbnailTable 2. American Telemedicine Association Guidelines for Informed Consent and Preparation for SessionsView larger image > in this page > in new window> Download slideTurvey et al., 2013, p. 11).Evaluators using VC to conduct RCCEs must meet the ethical standards of their respective disciplines and apply these ethical standards to the virtual task. Evaluators using VC must establish appropriate verification, confidentiality, and security parameters consistent with the CCE and the privacy interests of the parties (Shore et al., 2018). This includes taking care to verify the identity of those being interviewed or observed, using procedures to protect the privacy of those being interviewed, and using technology with adequate security protections. Evaluators also must provide use technologies that provide quality audio and video images for the interviews or observations.Another ethical issue reflects allegiance to the principles of evidence-based or evidence-informed practice. In the context of CCEs, evaluators expect that, when providing opinions and testimony based on novel or emerging principles or methods, they make known the status and limitations of these principles and methods (APA, 2013a, p. 9). Standard 9.02 (“Use of Assessments”) of the Ethics Code is particularly relevant when considering an alternative method of assessment, be this an alternative interviewing technique or test administration:Psychologists administer, adapt, score, interpret, or use assessment techniques, interviews, tests, or instruments in a manner and for purposes that are appropriate in light of the research on or evidence of the usefulness and proper application of the techniques.Psychologists use assessment instruments whose validity and reliability have been established for use with members of the population tested. When such validity or reliability has not been established, psychologists describe the strengths and limitations of test results and interpretation. (APA, 2017)Best Practice Guidelines for VCEvaluators who use VC must competently and reasonably adapt the best practice guidelines that have been developed for VC and other telemental health service deliveries to the CCE context. Like the detailed provisions of the conceptual model outlined earlier, best practice guidelines emphasize consistent practices and are designed to reduce practitioner errors. It is important to assume competent use of VC in considering its use. Many opposed to using VC cite fears and problems that are often easily remedied with adequate planning and forethought. For example, some have noted concerns about the identity of the person being interviewed or that another person might be present in the room coaching the interviewee, either adult or child, about how to answer certain questions. These concerns can be dispelled by scanning the room prior to or even during interviews. The value of use of VC should be judged on the “steel man argument” (what is likely when competent practices are followed) rather than a “straw man argument” (where those using VC are characterized as making silly mistakes that reflect incompetence in the evaluator rather than problems in the technique).The acceptance of use of VC technology in clinical practice, as shown by numerous professional theory and evidence-informed best practice guidelines, is undeniable. For psychiatrists, the American Psychiatric Association has recognized VC as a legitimate service delivery mechanism since 1998 and, in 2018, together with the ATA, promulgated a statement, “Best Practices in Videoconferencing-Based Telemental Health” (Shore et al., 2018). The American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2008) introduced its guidelines, “Practice Parameter for Telepsychiatry With Children and Adolescents,” in 2008. For psychologists, the APA issued “Guidelines for the Practice of Telepsychology” in 2013. The APA guidelines were presented as informed by professional theories, evidence-based practices, and definitions in an effort to offer the best guidance in the practice of telepsychology (APA, 2013a). For social workers, a group of professional organizations (National Association of Social Workers, Association of Social Work Boards, Council on Social Work Education, & Clinical Social Work Association, 2017) created the “Standards for Technology in Social Work Practice” in 2017.In addition, telepractitioners are developing their own professional identity and have promulgated additional evidence-based best practice guidelines. The ATA, an interdisciplinary professional group, has published multiple practice guidelines. These include (a) “Evidence-Based Practice for Telemental Health” in 2009 (published in 2011), (b) “Practice Guidelines for Videoconferencing-Based Telemental Health” in 2009, (c) “Practice Guidelines for Video-Based Online Mental Health Service” in 2013 (Turvey et al., 2013), (d) “A Lexicon of Assessment and Outcome Measures for Telemental Health” in 2013 (Shore et al., 2014), and (e) “Practice Guidelines for Telemental Health with Children and Adolescents” in 2017 (Myers et al., 2017).Deviations from the guidelines may be acceptable, but departures from customary protocols must be justified.If circumstances warrant, a practitioner may responsibly pursue a course of action different from the guidelines when, in the reasonable judgment of the practitioner, such action is indicated by the condition of the patient, restrictions or limits on available resources, or advances in information or technology subsequent to publication of the guidelines. Nonetheless, a practitioner who uses an approach that is significantly different from these guidelines is strongly advised to provide documentation, in the patient record, that is adequate to explain the approach pursued. (Turvey et al., 2013, p. 5)Practical Considerations Regarding Using VC in Assessments and TherapyParties agreeing to an RCCE must be functionally capable of using the technology. While no studies have specifically identified any patient subgroup that does not benefit from, or is harmed by, mental health care provided through remote VC (Turvey et al., 2013), professionals using VC must determine that interviewees are intellectually, emotionally, physically, linguistically, and functionally capable of using the technology (Luxton et al., 2016). “Other key telepractice elements include assessment of the impact of culture on the client/patient’s (a) overall comfort/socialization with the behavioral health system; (b) comfort and familiarity with the technology; (c) communication, rapport, and trust; and (d) perceptions of confidentiality” (Luxton et al., 2016, paragraph 1758).“Working via technology, then, also requires an understanding of how technology alters a professional clinical relationship and how to compensate for such alterations” (Luxton et al., 2016, paragraph 149). Establishing rapport and an alliance in the provider-interviewee relationship is as important in interactive VC as it is in in-person contact. Rapport allows for the interviewee to be more forthcoming with past and current history and cognitive and emotional experiences. While using VC, interviewers may need to flexibly and creatively adjust how they can communicate things such as understanding or empathy (Grady et al., 2011, p. 136). Verbal communications may be more deliberate to adjust for any auditory lags related to technology use and to clearly indicate when the teleprovider has finished speaking in order to facilitate reciprocity in communication (Nelson et al., 2017, p. 77).Possible LimitationsThere are limitations to use of VC, both in general and within RCCEs. “The lack of physical presence may limit the range of information available or how it can be observed” (Luxton et al., 2014, p. 28). Nonverbal information is useful for determining the patient’s emotional state and, in some cases, risk behaviors. For example, olfactory sensory information can provide clinically relevant information regarding hygiene as well as the use of alcohol or other substances. The observation of psychomotor and other medical symptoms is also important to observe during psychological assessments. VC assessments may be influenced by camera angle, screen size, room characteristics, or other technical factors that prohibit the observation of all behaviors. The lack of physical presence, however, may limit the range of information available, how it can be observed, or how the patient presents (Luxton et al., 2014). This is not, however, an insurmountable obstacle.Home-based telemental health services may not be appropriate if there is a serious concern for patient safety (Gloff et al., 2015). “Certain high-risk families, such as families with maltreatment histories, may be inappropriate for remote telemental healthcare” (Comer & Myers, 2016, p. 299). Patients with a history of adverse reactions to treatment (e.g., severe panic attacks) or those who are at high risk of harm to self or others (e.g., family members in the case of home-based telemental health) may not be appropriate for telemental assessment (Luxton, O’Brien, McCann, & Mishkind, 2012).Providers are expected to consider geographic location, technological competence (both psychologist and client/patient), medical conditions, mental status and stability, psychiatric diagnosis, current or historic use of substances, treatment history, and therapeutic needs that may be relevant to assessing the appropriateness of the services offered. Prior to engaging in remote assessments, it is wise to review the patient’s clinical history to determine potential clinical, cognitive, and/or sensory deficits that could impair their ability to use telehealth technology (APA, 2013a). While telemental health developed out of a need in underserved rural population areas, patients in densely populated areas also have benefitted from decreased travel times caused by high traffic volumes that make traveling even short distances a problem.Defending VC in RCCEs in Court: The Evidentiary ArgumentEvaluators choosing to use VC in RCCEs may face challenges in court about whether their methods meet the legal standards for admissibility of expert testimony found in the Daubert trilogy and/or the Frye case for admissibility of expert testimony (Flynn, 2019). To successfully defend their work product, evaluators must demonstrate that they qualify as an expert with competencies in CCEs and the technology that was used and that they have properly and reliably collected sufficient relevant data and facts to support their inferences, conclusions, and opinions.The position espoused here is that the uniqueness of a child custody evaluation is found in the conceptual model for the evaluation that informs the collection of data and facts and in the manner in which the analysis of the data and facts is conducted, not in the data collection methods themselves. That is, both clinical and forensic evaluations involve gathering information from documents, interviews, observations, and testing in order to address the presenting problem(s) or situation. These contextual considerations are, of course, very important, but RCCEs should be independently considered based on their scientific and empirical merit rather than on general acceptance among like-minded members of some guild (Faigman, 2013, pp. 908–909). In each instance, there are requirements to establish rapport, elicit cooperation with the data collection task, and objectively collect data and facts about the presenting problem(s) and situation. In both clinical and forensic settings, evaluators are expected to apply the same intellectual rigor to the tasks (Kumho v. Carmichael, 1999). Accuracy and objectivity are always important, whether informing treatment of a patient or helping the court in a legal dispute. By following these principles, evaluators performing RCCEs can produce valid and reliable reports that will help courts in their efforts to revolve custody disputes.ConclusionThe COVID-19 pandemic has at least temporarily and perhaps permanently changed the landscape of mental health service delivery, including the conduct of child custody evaluations. Currently and into the foreseeable future, some CCEs must be remotely done via VC to ensure the safety of the parties and the evaluators. The learning curve for using these technologies in this context is a steep one. There is a lot to learn and a need to learn and apply it quickly. VC can become the lens through which data and facts are collected (J. W. Gould, personal communication, June 20, 2020). Evaluators must use technologies that provide high-quality audio and video images for the interviews and observations. Evaluators need to be prepared to provide information regarding the technology they used, why they chose that technology, and how that technology worked during the data collection interviews or observations. They must establish that they used appropriate verification, confidentiality, and security parameters consistent with the CCE and the privacy interests of the parties (Shore et al., 2018).Family courts that were overwhelmed prior to the pandemic are likely to be even more overwhelmed when they reopen. There likely will be many changes, but the need for the help of experts, including custody evaluators, is likely to remain a priority. For evaluators who conduct RCCEs, the new competence requirements will encompass both CCE and telemental health methods. In these evaluations, evaluators must think through, individualize, and adapt methodologies to help the court answer the questions that were the foci of the dispute.This article articulated a conceptual model illustrating a dynamic, flexible process-oriented approach to creating and defining the scope of the evaluation and collecting data and facts from multiple sources, as well as a process that combines scientific and investigative principles for analyzing this information via comparisons with hypotheses and theories about the case. Regardless of whether a CCE is conducted in person or remotely via VC, evaluators must be able to describe and explain their choices of how they investigated the relevant factors and the psycholegal questions that were the foci of the evaluation and the ways analysis connects the data and facts to their conclusions and recommendations.This article details the growth of the telemedicine and telemental health communities over the past 10 to 15 years from an alternative to reach underserved populations to an alternative within the mainstream mental health professions. This growth is mainly a story of successful applications across people of different ages, different clinical and forensic populations, and different clinical and forensic tasks. In the absence of a vaccine for COVID-19, it is difficult to think of safe mental health service delivery without accommodations. Properly conducted RCCE may be a necessary safe substitute for in-person processes. There are limitations and situations where VC may not be a safe alternative, but the child custody community—for example, courts, attorneys, evaluators, and families—should accept RCCEs as a valid alternative that, when properly done, can help resolve custody disputes. In November 2019, COVID-19—the infectious, highly communicable, and potentially fatal disease caused by a novel coronavirus—originated in Wuhan, China. Within months, its devastating impact had spread worldwide. By April 2020, the United States had the highest number of confirmed COVID-19 cases and COVID-19-related deaths in the world (World Health Organization, 2020). Faced with its most significant public health emergency in modern history, virtually all aspects of U.S. health care were impacted. The American Psychological Association (APA) was quick to provide guidance to mental health practitioners, researchers, and policymakers who faced unprecedented hurdles for conducting their work. Almost immediately, e-mental health (also referred to as telepsychology) was the logistical solution put into practice (Liu et al., 2020; Perrin et al., 2020).E-mental health is the procurement, storage, sharing, and provision of mental health information and services via electronic communication including online databases, telephone, videoconferencing (live, two-way interactions), email, interactive websites, software applications (i.e., apps), and social media. It can be conducted synchronously (in-the-moment) or asynchronously (training modules, email, etc.) and stand-alone or supplement traditional mental health care protocol. It can take place in emergency rooms, outpatient clinics, independent practice—virtually any mental health setting acting as a “hub” for services. Dating back to 1959, e-mental health is associated with improved accessibility, flexibility, reduced costs, times savings, decreased self-stigma, and consumer engagement (Cowan et al., 2019; Lal & Adair, 2014; Luxton et al., 2016). From 2010 to 2017, the United States increased psychiatric e-mental health (i.e., mental health services, such as medication prescribing and management, provided by medical professionals) in state-run facilities from 15% to 29% (Spivak et al., 2020). Several subspecialties of psychology—most notably, counseling psychology—have built evidence bases for its practice (Jacobsen & Kohout, 2010; Luxton et al., 2011). Heilbrun and Brooks (2010) set assessing development and impact of new technologies as part of a proposed agenda for forensic psychology over 10 years ago, but a decade later, forensic psychology’s technology use and exploration lags behind its counterparts.Regarding COVID-19, jails and prisons became “hot spots” for disease transmission (Williams & Ivory, 2020). Correctional settings make for close quarters, and COVID-19 transmission precautions (e.g., limiting one-on-one interactions, social distancing) are nearly impossible for individuals who are incarcerated. Recognizing the high risk for COVID-19 infection, some correctional institutions put into place protective policies such as prohibiting face-to-face visitation (Federal Bureau of Prisons, 2020), including those for forensic mental health practitioners. This severely limited the judicial system’s access to individuals who are incarcerated and incarcerated individuals’ access to mental health evaluation and treatment.Technology as applied to court settings is not new. Videoconferencing has long been common between the courts and correctional settings and is a feasible alternative to in-person hearings (Davis et al., 2015). Defendants have reported the same level of satisfaction and collaboration with their attorneys whether they were communicating in-person or over videoconference (McDonald et al., 2016), and mental health experts have testified via videoconference for decades (U.S. v. Gigante, 1999).Psychiatric e-mental health has made significant progress in correctional settings with diverse clientele across the world (Magaletta et al., 1998; Mars et al., 2012; Maruschak et al., 2016; Senanayake et al., 2018; Shore et al., 2008). A systematic review of psychiatric e-mental health videoconferencing services produced 89 studies that cumulatively suggested this service method has reliability and acceptability in forensic settings and the courts, savings in costs and travel, and enhanced safety and security (Sales et al., 2018). As of 2016, 28 state Department of Corrections systems offered psychiatric e-mental health in conjunction with in-person services (Maruschak et al., 2016). According to North Carolina’s prison system, psychiatric e-mental health “has been invaluable in linking providers to incarcerated people housed in remote prisons where it is not feasible to have a provider based on site” (Sheitman & Williams, 2019, p. 356). Accessibility is increasingly important, considering approximately 20% of jail inmates across the United States are housed in rural jails, most of which are difficult to reach and do not have on-site treatment providers (Kang-Brown & Subramanian, 2017).There is sound reasoning for why forensic e-mental health is a good option for the evaluation and intervention of justice-involved individuals. Individuals who are incarcerated have higher levels of mental health needs than the general public (Bureau of Justice Statistics, 2017), and are, arguably, among those who need psychological attention the most. They are frequently diagnosed with co-occurring mental health and substance use disorders, and have higher rates of traumatic brain injury, requiring complex treatment approaches (Beaudette & Stewart, 2016; Bronson & Berzofsky, 2017; Kessler et al., 2003; Prins, 2014; Shiroma et al., 2012; Sung et al., 2010). In vivo and psychiatric e-mental health modalities (such as medication management) are often critical, but frequently insufficient without other forms of mental health intervention such as psychotherapy and coping skills development. Yet the systems put in place to address the needs of justice-involved individuals are often underresourced and marginalized. In many forensic settings, medication management is the extent of mental health treatment available.Although the COVID-19 crisis has been unique, it provided impetus for the field to critically examine forensic mental health practice, research, and policy and their relationships with technology. “Non-clinical” psychology-law colleagues have practice, research, and policy recommendations on technology-focused topics such as body-worn cameras (Lum et al., 2019) and recording interrogations and eyewitness lineups (Fitzgerald et al., 2018; Kassin et al., 2019; Wells et al., 2020). Technology as applied to forensic mental health is a developing area; however, it is still lacking when considering the many mental health needs of justice-involved individuals. What forensic e-mental health research is available? What legal and mental health needs can be sufficiently addressed via forensic e-mental health, and which should be prioritized for research? How can we integrate practice and research into policy, and how can they complement one another? To address these questions, we present evidence and scholarly commentaries on forensic e-mental health evaluation and intervention, which are used to recommend action for research and policy.Review: Components of Forensic E-Mental HealthForensic EvaluationForensic mental health evaluation is a key component of clinical forensic practice and includes clinical interview and assessment of specific legal issues (e.g., criminal competencies, mental state at the time of the offense, violence risk). Technology-related research has examined the assessment process and use of electronic collateral sources. By far, most forensic e-mental health research involves one’s competency to proceed.Competency to ProceedA 2019 survey of 156 forensic mental health evaluators indicated that approximately 28% had conducted a competency to proceed evaluation via videoconference (Batastini et al.), although this percentage is likely much higher in the aftermath of COVID-19. In one of the first studies to examine standardized evaluations of competence to proceed via videoconference (Lexcen et al., 2006), researchers administered the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale-Anchored Version (BPRS-V) and the MacArthur Competence Assessment Tool-Criminal Adjudication (MacCAT-CA) to a sample of 72 inpatient forensic evaluatees. In the first group, measures were administered by a “local” (in-person) evaluator, while a second, remote evaluator observed and scored administrations over videoconference. In the second group, the remote evaluator administered the measures while the local evaluator observed and scored the measures. In the third group, one local evaluator administered the measures, while a second local evaluator observed and scored only. Although the experimental conditions lacked ecological validity, findings demonstrated adequate interrater reliabilities across the evaluator groups, which provided support that remote BPRS-V and MacCAT-CA administration was not a significant departure from local administration, and can potentially serve as a reliable component of evaluating competence to proceed.A randomized controlled trial of competency evaluations using another tool—the Georgia Court Competency Test–Mississippi State Hospital revision (GCCT-MSH)—demonstrated similar results. Manguno-Mire et al. (2007) randomized forensic inpatients to either local or remote videoconference evaluation formats. In the first condition, a primary evaluator administered the GCCT-MSH locally, while a second evaluator scored the measure remotely. In the second condition, the primary evaluator administered the measure remotely, while the second evaluator scored the measure locally. The results were promising, in that GCCT-MHS scores across conditions had impressive (r ∼ .92) interrater reliabilities. These findings along with Lexcen et al. (2006) are encouraging, but should not be interpreted as full and certain support for remote competency evaluations. Specifically, it should be noted that Lexcen et al. (2006) and Manguno-Mire et al. (2007) had limited sample sizes. Further, these studies examined only one psychometric property: interrater reliability of scores from specific competency measures. Standardized assessment performance reflects only one data point an evaluator may consider when rendering an opinion of a defendant’s competency. To date, it remains unclear if the validity of evaluators’ competency determinations would vary as a function of the evaluation format.Technology as Collateral InformationCollateral sources are requisite for conducting an informed and thorough forensic evaluation (Heilbrun et al., 2014). Consistent with the broad definition of e-mental health, “Googling” clients may be one technological avenue of procuring collateral information related to mental health symptoms and status. Although this practice is generally viewed as a breach of privacy that is unacceptable in typical clinical contexts, the rules shift in forensic evaluation, when collateral information is key to prudent practice. Further, additional electronic collateral information, such as recorded Miranda waivers, surveillance and bodycam video, email, Internet searches, and social media posts, is more readily available for evaluators’ considerations as technology has proliferated.Although forensic mental health scholars have begun to discuss the risks and benefits of Internet-derived data (see Batastini & Vitacco, 2020), there has been little empirical investigation into the matter. In a survey of 102 forensic evaluators, 63.7% reported using social media as collateral information, most often in mental state and child custody evaluations (Coffey et al., 2018). In general, evaluators reported that social media information was not as helpful in developing their forensic opinion as were hospital and police records, clinical interview, surveillance tapes, support staff, and family members. Nevertheless, evaluators did indicate that social media could be helpful in corroborating mental illness, assessing mental state, and determining functional abilities. Interestingly, some evaluators reported using social media (e.g., blogs and podcasts) as data specifically for scoring risk assessment tools. Primary apprehensions over social media use in forensic evaluations included concerns about authenticity, reliability, privacy, consent, and relevance. This small pool of evaluators does not represent the field at large, and evaluators should consider Internet-based data as a form of collateral information to be sought on an individual case basis (Pirelli et al., 2016). Prudent evaluators will consult ethical codes, specialty guidelines, and clinical manuals specific to forensic psychology for determining appropriate use before seeking Internet-based data (Batastini & Vitacco, 2020; Pirelli et al., 2017).Forensic InterventionIn a 2012 practitioner survey, psychotherapists projected that technology would play a key role in psychotherapy by the year 2020 (Norcross et al., 2013). Indeed, technological capabilities have quickly advanced how practitioners conduct mental health intervention since Smith and Glass’s (1977) landmark meta-analysis demonstrating psychotherapy’s effectiveness. In fact, enough literature has been produced that e-mental health interventions have also been meta-analyzed, demonstrating that psychotherapy conducted by telephone or videoconference produce results similar to in-person therapeutic exchanges and is feasible for practice (Backhaus et al., 2012; Jenkins-Guarnieri et al., 2015). With the advent of smart phones, self-management mobile apps have gained in popularity in general, but also in treatment technology (Linardon et al., 2019). Smartphone apps can track moods and physiological functioning, facilitate skills acquisition, serve as virtual coaches, time-stamp mental health-related “assignments,” come preprogrammed with psychoeducation resources and crisis contact information, act as reminders for therapy or other appointments, and provide GPS navigation and monitoring (Luxton et al., 2011).While general psychotherapy e-mental health has proliferated, forensic e-mental health treatment and intervention has inched behind. This is a missed opportunity. Up to 26% of jail inmates and 14% of prisoners report “serious psychological distress” (Bronson & Berzofsky, 2017), yet jails and prisons often lack mental health professionals who are trained in psychotherapy. Encouragingly, the small body of forensic e-mental health intervention research available appears promising.A meta-analysis (Batastini et al., 2016) identified only three empirical between-subjects studies published between 2000 and 2014 specific to e-mental health in correctional settings, and only one (Morgan et al., 2008) focused on psychotherapy intervention. The all-male study, which took place across a general medical center (“hub”) and correctional facility (“remote” site), did not utilize random assignment to treatment conditions (video conference or face-to-face), although the authors noted no marked differences in diagnoses across groups. They found no significant differences in incarcerated individuals’ ratings of working alliance, service engagement, or service satisfaction across conditions. Although this study is an important first step in understanding treatment process, it did not evaluate key outcome variables such as symptom reduction.Several studies have been published since Batastini et al.’s (2016) meta-analysis, and there are many more pilot and feasibility studies that did not utilize comparison groups or “traditional” correctional samples (see Kip et al., 2018). They have concerned specific treatment populations, such as those in administrative segregation, or specific treatment targets, such as substance use and anger management. We now review these niche interventions.Administrative SegregationFollowing Batastini and colleagues’ (2016) meta-analysis, Batastini and Morgan (2016) compared prison inmates in administrative segregation across an in-person CBT coping skills group (n = 12, limited to two participants per group given administrative issues), a coping skills group conducted via teleconference (n = 24, limited to six participants per group), and a no-treatment control group (n = 13). Participants were primarily diagnosed with substance use (38.5%) or mood-related disorder (26.5%) and had an average of 1.3 years in segregated housing. Given the research context, participation was voluntary and random assignment was not methodologically feasible. However, the authors did not identify significant differences in age, ethnicity, offense type, or diagnostic considerations across groups. Findings showed no significant group differences across symptom severity, criminogenic thinking, client satisfaction, working alliance, and perceptions of the treatment group. This study is quite promising for hard-to-reach, administratively segregated individuals, who report more anxiety and depression relative to individuals in the general-population (Chadick et al., 2018). However, the sample sizes were small, necessitating additional research to explore the efficacy of tele-interventions with this population.Community TreatmentTechnology in the form of electronic monitoring has been an integral part of community corrections for decades (Nellis, 2016); however, more nuanced, treatment-focused approaches to offender reentry are few and far between. Continuum of care is critical for justice-involved individuals with severe and persistent mental illness, and integrated rehabilitation systems should address their complex needs (Pinals & Fuller, 2020). Justice-involved individuals who are released from correctional facilities and reenter rural communities may continue to have significant needs but decreased accessibility to mental health care relative to their suburban and urban counterparts. Forensic e-mental health interventions are potential solutions for treating complex mental health needs and reaching difficult-to-access individuals, such as those who lack transportation, live in rural areas, or are less mobile due to disability or medical vulnerabilities.One novel program, Sober IPT (i.e., interpersonal psychotherapy for substance use) aimed to reduce substance use upon community reentry by maintaining continuum of care for justice-involved women with major depressive disorder and co-occurring substance use disorders (Johnson et al., 2015). In this study, women who were incarcerated met with an in-person counselor and attended individual and group therapy for eight weeks prior to their release. At reentry, researchers provided the women mobile “sober phones,” which were preprogrammed to only allow calls to sober resources (e.g., their prison counselor, sober friends and family, and Alcoholics Anonymous) and crisis intervention services. Participants then followed up with their counselor via the sober phone for three months to review goals, address substance use triggers, and receive social support. Participants had good treatment contact and reported the sober phone system was helpful. Although there was no control condition in this study and its sample size was small (N = 22), participant feedback allowed the authors to conclude that the continuum of care “pocket case manager” was worthwhile.Substance UseAlthough the evidence bases for forensic-specific e-mental health is quite limited, foundational work on “forensic-adjacent” issues can inform forensic e-mental health practice. Given the high rates of co-occurring mental health and substance use disorders among offender populations, substance use treatment is particularly relevant. E-mental health interventions taking place via Internet modules, text messaging, self-managed applications, and social networking can be effective in reducing alcohol use and its related risk-taking behaviors (O’Rourke et al., 2016). King and colleagues (2009, 2014) used in-person treatment comparison groups to evaluate substance use outcomes of an e-mental health intervention. Treatment adherence, substance use, therapeutic alliance, and client satisfaction were similar across groups, although overall participants reported preferring e-mental health due to its increased accessibility. A meta-analysis of e-mental health interventions for individuals with substance use disorders in remission found, when compared to control groups, approximately 57% of e-mental health interventions had positive effects (Nesvåg & McKay, 2018), and similar effects were found for adults with problem drinking (Riper et al., 2018). In another meta-analysis specific to alcohol use, approximately 88% had positive effects on substance use measures following e-mental health intervention (Fowler et al., 2016). Virtual reality environments have also been used in cue-exposure behavioral therapy to reduce substance use cravings (Hone-Blanchet et al., 2014).AggressionThe Veterans Affairs (VA) system, the largest integrated health system in the United States, has been a pioneer in videoconferencing mental health services and developed at least 20 e-mental health apps (Gould et al., 2019). Among these, several pertain to coping skills development and anger management. A single group, pre- posttest study of the Remote Exercises for Learning Anger and Excitation Management app demonstrated that following the app intervention, veterans showed decreased anger expression and improvements in social functioning (Morland et al., 2016). In a randomized control trial, the 6-month Cognitive Applications for Life Management (CALM) app intervention (goal setting and planning along with attention training) was associated with significantly decreased self-reported anger (25%) relative to the control group (8% reduction) among veterans with traumatic brain injury and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (Elbogen et al., 2019). Further, collateral contacts reported that CALM participants showed significantly less aggressive behaviors compared to controls. The VA also offers the Veterans Affairs Anger & Irritability Management Skills program (Greene et al., 2014) through online access.To summarize, forensic e-mental health interventions are in short supply but growing in number. Thus far, only a few studies have examined an intervention’s impact using between-subjects and/or randomized controlled trials, making this area fertile ground for future research prior to wide adaptation in treatment settings.Research Priorities for Forensic E-Mental HealthA clear implication from this literature review is the sheer lack of empirical research regarding forensic e-mental health. Considering many forensic mental health questions will be similar to general e-health (e.g., symptom reduction and management, social and coping skills development), researchers and practitioners may somewhat generalize that literature’s nominal findings for use with forensic populations. However, forensic and correctional populations are distinct from the general population and the forensic mental health field is frequently tasked with addressing psycho-legal questions which require extensive training and expertise. Thus, it is imperative that researchers do not assume that nonforensic e-mental health research will generalize and, instead, consider the application of technology to this specific subdiscipline. Adding technology to forensic practice without establishing the benefits and understanding the costs could be deleterious. Considering stakeholders’ (criminal justice-involved individuals, treatment providers, corrections professionals, policymakers) needs, cost, and feasibility, we next prioritize key topics that should rise to the top of the forensic e-mental health research agenda.Validity, Reliability, and Feasibility of Forensic E-Mental Health EvaluationsArguably, forensic mental health evaluation is the foundation of forensic mental health practice: Evaluation findings are often prominent as an individual proceeds through the criminal justice system and influence how supervisory figures and treatment providers determine which interventions, and to which degrees, are suitable. Thus far, the majority of forensic e-mental health evaluation research has focused on the topic of competence to proceed. This is not surprising, given that upward of 60,000 are conducted each year and the “competency crisis” is a pressing issue (Gowensmith, 2019b; Poythress et al., 2002). But there are additional forensic mental health evaluation domains that warrant research investigation. For example, in the Batastini et al. (2019) survey of forensic mental health evaluators, respondents who had experience with videoconference evaluations endorsed conducting violence risk assessment most frequently, followed by competency to proceed, mental state, child custody, and disability evaluations. Assessments of violence risk and mental state can be much more tedious than in-the-moment competency evaluations, given that they typically require lengthier interviews and, when called for, larger assessment batteries. For mental state evaluations in particular, evaluators may inquire about minute details that could be frustrating to seek and answer in the context of video conferencing. Put simply, they most often will require more time and effort than evaluations of competency and may not be the most appropriate for videoconference. Given that practitioners are conducting these evaluations, psycho-legal referral questions aside from competency to proceed are important research avenues to follow.Although we can extrapolate many of the more general videoconferencing literature to forensic contexts, researchers should further examine remote administration of forensic assessment and forensic-relevant instruments, as have researchers studying neuropsychological test administration via videoconference (Brearly et al., 2017). Forensic researchers should focus on the most commonly conducted measures as identified by practitioners, such as the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI), Personality Assessment Inventory, Historical Clinical Risk Management-20 (Douglas et al., 2013), and standardized adjudicative competence measures (Archer et al., 2006; Neal & Grisso, 2014). Several of these measures, such as the MMPI and PAI, are already available via online platforms. They can be administered remotely and securely via screen-sharing technology. Stimuli presentation can be standardized on screen to a significant degree (albeit an examinee’s setting can potentially interfere with administration). But clinician-administered tests, including many critical response style measures (e.g., Miller Forensic Assessment of Symptoms Test, Structured Interview of Reported Symptoms, Test of Memory Malingering), allow more room for error given individual differences in administration. Arguably, response style measures have a greater applied range compared to referral-specific (e.g., competency, violence risk) measures and should be situated high on the research agenda, given that assessment of response style is imperative across all forensic evaluation contexts (Rogers & Bender, 2020).Another important area to explore is whether video recording of an evaluation impacts response style. There are benefits and risks to this practice. On one hand, video creates a more complete examination record, can help resolve later confusions or disputes, and refresh forensic evaluators’ memories when drawing clinical opinions and preparing for trial (Siegel et al., 2018; Zonana et al., 1999). On the other, the process of video recording may impact evaluation dynamics and performance (Otto & Krauss, 2009). Nevertheless, some policymakers have moved forward with certain video recording requirements (e.g., Colorado Code of Criminal Procedure, 2017). A survey of evaluators practicing in Colorado indicated that they generally opposed recording evaluations due to technical challenges, confidentiality concerns, potential misuse, and invalidation of the evaluation (Potts et al., 2018). Before coming to conclusions on this issue, researchers should understand whether video recording produces differing results.An additional area ripe for research concerns the application of forensic e-mental health with linguistically and culturally diverse populations. Over the last several decades global migration has increased such that the U.S. Census Bureau postulated that immigration will fuel population level demographic changes in the United States (Vespa et al., 2020). Reflecting these immigration trends, approximately 21% of the entire U.S. population speak a language other than English in the home (U.S. Census Bureau, 2020). It is reasonable then, that interpreters are commonly used in forensic practice (Weiss & Rosenfeld, 2012). Despite this, very little research has addressed the impact of language interpretation in forensic evaluation, and these samples were drawn from populations with relatively diverse demographics (Kois et al., 2013; Paradis et al., 2016; Varela et al., 2011) Researchers can consider the impact of in vivo versus remote interpretation services, as well as baseline accuracy rates for language interpretation. This work is particularly important to ensure reliable and valid exchange of information and ultimately inform best practice as the population continues to diversify.Somewhat relatedly, researchers should consider the feasibility of forensic e-mental health evaluations with diverse populations. For example, older adults are less likely to report comfort with digital devices and adults living with a physical impairment are less likely to use the Internet than those without such impairment (Gitlow, 2014; Zickuhr & Smith, 2013). Further, across the United States there are severe disparities in Internet accessibility, with lower income and rural populations less likely to have consistent access (Pew Research Center, 2019; U.S. Census Bureau, 2018). Researchers should consider if accommodations are appropriate for individuals participating in forensic e-mental health evaluations who experience discomfort with technology and/or the Internet due to unfamiliarity. If any accommodations are implemented, it is imperative to understand how they affect the validity of the evaluation.Technology-Facilitated InterventionsCompetence RestorationFor the last decade, high rates of competency referrals, forensic mental health staff shortages, and various administrative issues have contributed to the length of time defendants await competency evaluation and/or restoration (Gowensmith, 2019b). There is a dearth of research on restoration in general (Heilbrun et al., 2019), but restoration facilitated by technology could be an efficient practice by broadcasting restoration instructors to difficult-to-reach defendants (e.g., in rural jails or in the community) or those in understaffed facilities. Another benefit of conducting restoration via asynchronous e-means could ensure that defendants new to competence restoration receive psycho-legal instruction in a scaffolded and organized manner, rather than joining a group on a revolving basis. E-administration of competence restoration protocol could also be beneficial for defendants who have special cognitive or language needs (Casas & Leany, 2017). Given that a videoconference approach could reach diverse defendants, it lends itself to outcomes that are more generalizable and research using video modules could enhance fidelity for standardized competency restoration protocols.Cognitive remediation could be an effective tool for individuals undergoing competence to proceed restoration, who are most often diagnosed with psychotic disorders (Pirelli & Zapf, 2020). There are nuanced neurocognitive components to the competency to proceed criteria outlined in the seminal Dusky v. United States (1960) decision: specifically, attention, working memory, and executive functioning. Research indicates that cognitive remediation, typically conducted via computer programs, can improve these functions among individuals with severe and persistent mental illness (Chan et al., 2015; Medalia et al., 2001; Medalia & Richardson, 2005; Medalia & Saperstein, 2013). It follows that cognitive remediation could also improve neurocognitive functioning among defendants opined incompetent to proceed. This assertion is supported by forensic mental health and neuropsychology theory (Schwalbe & Medalia, 2007; Zapf, 2013), as well as a small pilot study that revealed cognitive remediation can improve Dusky reasoning abilities, particularly among individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia (Wilson, 2015).Community TreatmentAs observed by Leifman and Coffey (2015) “. . . one look at ‘treatment as usual’ in many communities would suggest that our typical practice of mental health interventions in criminal justice settings has remained stagnant for decade.” (p. 201). Community interventions in particular fit directly into an exciting “space” for forensic e-mental health research to flourish. Technology, which can be programmed to vary the level of supervision and intervention intensity and frequency, is an opportunity to match an offender’s specific needs to their appropriate level of supervisory and clinical contact. A recent National Institute of Justice collaboration between the RAND Corporation and the University of Denver focused specifically on how stakeholders can use technology to improve community supervision (Russo et al., 2019). Participants identified benefits for individuals under supervision (electronic “check-ins,” automated appearance reminders, positive reinforcement for prosocial behavior), as well as benefits for supervisors themselves (automated reminders for appearance dates and workloads, interactive resources that prompt officers about specific issues to address with offenders). They prioritized a research agenda: How best to hold individuals under supervision accountable via technology? Are virtual check-ins effective at reducing failed appearances and other compliance matters? Which populations are most amenable to e-supervision, and how long should e-monitoring occur? Participants noted that mobile data could lend to validation of “homegrown” risk measures, data mining, and machine learning to identify which interventions and timings are most effective. Ideas such as these can serve as beginning points for researchers interested in community intervention.Forensic e-mental health applies not just to offenders reentering the community, but also individuals followed by assisted outpatient treatment, drug and mental health diversion courts, and other treatment-intensive community programs. To maintain treatment gains among general (nonforensic) samples, individuals exiting inpatient or residential substance use treatment should have continued care for an average of 3 to 6 months (Proctor & Herschman, 2014). Interventions and social support administered via mobile application increases accessibility, and ultimately continuum of care. Recognizing this, the Veterans Health Administration began giving video-enabled tablets with data plans to treatment-seeking individuals who faced barriers to care, such as poor health, lack of transportation, or rural setting (Jacobs et al., 2019). In a retrospective comparison study, Jacobs and colleagues found that the tablet program was associated with improved continuum of care: increased psychotherapy sessions, stronger medication adherence, and fewer missed appointments in general. A second study found that veterans were equally divided in preferring treatment via the tablet program, preferring treatment in-person, or having no preference (Slightam et al., 2020). Despite these promising findings, both studies involved veterans and it is unknown if the beneficial effects of technology application generalize to the forensic population receiving treatment while being monitored in the community. If research establishes similarly positive outcomes with a community-dwelling forensic population, subsequent economic and public health benefits could be consequential.An additional research priority concerns treatment attrition. Treatment drop-out among forensic populations is a major concern as drop-out can have direct impact on mental health functioning as well as indirect legal impact for individuals under mandated treatment or supervision. In fact, one meta-analysis of 114 treatment programs found that violent offenders who began but did not complete mental health treatment were 10% to 23% more likely to recidivate (general, violent, or nonviolent) compared to treatment completers (Olver et al., 2011). These findings held regardless of treatment context (institutional or community-based), although community-dwelling individuals who terminated treatment early were most likely to recidivate. The research indicated that psychotic and personality disorder diagnoses, as well as negative treatment attitudes and behaviors, predicted dropout; however, the interventions neither necessarily targeted treatment engagement nor did they involve e-mental health. CBT-informed anger management intervention attrition was also associated with recidivism in a meta-analysis by Henwood et al. (2015). As such, targeting mental illness and motivation through mobile interventions could increase treatment completion, which could indirectly lead to decreased recidivism rates. Specific to offenders with severe and mental illness, research indicates that timely mental health treatment reduces the likelihood of criminal justice involvement (Constantine et al., 2012). Killikelly et al. (2017), in their systematic review of treatment adherence among individuals with psychosis, found that overall, 83% of participants adhered to web-based and app treatment. Although mobile technology may be promising with this treatment group, interventions should go above and beyond treatment linkage and completion, and address criminogenic as well as service needs in order to maximize results (Epperson et al., 2014; Skeem et al., 2014).Regarding specific psychotherapeutic orientations, cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) has garnered a strong track record with respect to treating justice-involved persons (Antonio & Crossett, 2017; Harrison et al., 2020; Higgs et al., 2018; Mpofu et al., 2018; Olver et al., 2020; Yoon et al., 2017). The Drexel Reentry Project (DRP) developed to address the needs of moderate- to high-risk justice-involved persons at community reentry, uses CBT principles in its multistep program (Heilbrun et al., 2017). Of note, DRP (2020) moved to telehealth in the context of COVID. Data collected from the program’s new treatment approach could make exciting contributions to our understanding of forensic e-mental health with justice-involved individuals under supervision.Substance UseSubstance use intervention is an urgent priority, particularly in the context of the opioid epidemic (Gostin et al., 2017). It is regularly associated with decreased recidivism in addition to decreased relapse (Moore et al., 2018). Probationers with co-occurring mental health and substance use disorders are more likely to recidivate compared to probationers with substance use or mental health problems (Balyakina et al., 2014). A meta-analysis of substance use and mental health reentry programs found that access to social support and housing and continuity of caseworker relationships pre- and postrelease were predictors of success (Kendall et al., 2018). Another study found that lack of social support was associated with substance use, specifically overdose, among people released from prison (Binswanger et al., 2012). Potentially, CBT and social support facilitated by mobile apps or other e-means could serve as a protective factor against substance use. Kramer Schmidt et al. (2018), who meta-analyzed literature on psychosocial interventions for alcohol use disorder, found that research assessing frequency, rather than intended or actual treatment duration, was associated with abstinence and lighter drinking. Frequent mobile “check-in” assessments could have a similar effect. Thus far, few substance use interventions have taken a “tech” approach with justice-involved persons.As of yet, no forensic e-mental health intervention has met the rigor of evidence-based evaluation, let alone one for community-dwelling individuals. A. Batastini (personal communication, April 28, 2020) is extending this line of work by developing an e-therapy app for justice-involved persons in the community. The project is in its developmental stages, with a patent application pending.Policy DirectionsAlthough there is relatively little research on forensic e-mental health, it is nevertheless moving forward. COVID-19 caught much of the field by surprise and practitioners, researchers, and policymakers had to make rapid decisions about how their work should proceed. We find that the time has come to consider implementation of forensic e-mental health on a larger scale, and are firm in the belief that it is far better to be proactive, rather than reactive, in advancing research so that we may best adapt our practice. At the same time, we acknowledge the relative dearth of research necessitates caution when implementing policies without careful consideration of the legal and ethical consequences of embracing forensic e-mental health. The following policy considerations are offered.Need for Professional ConsensusWhen the United States began to feel the major effects of COVID-19, psychologists looked to professional organizations, colleagues, test developers, technology experts, and literature on conducting work via e-means. The APA referred its community to its preexisting General Practice Guidelines for Telepsychology (Joint Task Force for the Development of Telepsychology Guidelines for Psychologists, 2013) and provided resources for teaching and research using technology. Subspecialty professional groups have contributed more specific practice recommendations (e.g., the Inter Organizational Practice Committee, comprising members of the American Academy of Clinical Neuropsychology (AACN), Division 40 of the APA, the National Academy of Neuropsychology (NAN), the American Board of Professional Neuropsychology (ABN), and the American Psychological Association Services). The American Psychology-Law Society (AP-LS) and the American Board of Forensic Psychology have not yet produced official positions on the use of technology in psychology-law clinical practice. Encouragingly, AP-LS has developed a telehealth task force (J. Groscup, personal communication, May 8, 2020) to develop and promulgate guidelines for the field. Technology is rapidly changing, more quickly than guidelines can be offered by professional organizations (Vitacco et al., 2018). Future guidelines should be broad to allow for extrapolation to newly developed technologies.Implementing Forensic E-Mental HealthThe great task of implementing a new forensic e-mental health system can appear overwhelming, if not daunting. Transitions can actually take place quite quickly: Yellowlees et al. (2020) described how, within 3 days, the University of California–Davis Health System transitioned to 100% telepsychiatry practice at the beginning of the COVID-19 crisis. Fortunately, numerous colleagues have published guidance on how to build and sustain these infrastructures (Hilty et al., 2015; Hilty et al., 2016; Luxton & Niemi, 2019; Smith et al., 2020). To begin, stakeholders, needs, and target populations must be identified. An “e-health Readiness Assessment” will help stakeholders plan project goals (e.g., is the purpose to conduct intake assessments, psychotherapy, emergency care, and/or research? What technology resources are already in place, and are they sufficient? What are our cultural and linguistic needs? What disparities can we anticipate?). Funding should be secured to adequately cover the costs of providing services (direct and indirect costs including technology, staff, and supporting materials), reimbursement protocol (when relevant) and continuity of care should be coordinated. Cost sharing across agencies or institutions (clinics, hospitals, corrections, the courts) should be preagreed upon, particularly given the fiscal complexities of federal, state, and county budgets. Technology should be specified with encryption networks. All professionals involved should be trained in e-mental health and the system’s supervisory and crisis protocols (e.g., what is the chain of command within and across institutions?). Careful documentation of challenges along the way should be part of a feedback loop used to continually improve infrastructure and practice. A review by Edge et al. (2019) is an especially valuable resource for those interested in implementation barriers to forensic e-mental health. “Case studies” on the many ways forensic e-mental health may be implemented are also available (see Batastini et al., 2020; Farabee et al., 2016; Kaftarian, 2019; Luxton & Lexcen, 2018; Magaletta et al., 2000; Miller et al., 2008).Traditional mental health care models will need to be adapted. Integrated care can be facilitated by tele-teaming, that is, communication among virtual treatment teams via synchronous or asynchronous electronic means (Waugh et al., 2015). Tele-teaming is well-suited for forensic mental health treatment providers, which can involve groups composed of psychologists, psychiatrists, social workers, primary care providers, probation officers or other community supervision professionals, and so on (Cuddeback et al., 2020; Parker et al., 2018). Tele-teaming models include multiperson treatments/therapies, facility-based-settings, where a remote individual of a specific discipline reaches out to a “home base” onsite mental health facility, and primary care models. In their scoping review, Parker et al. (2018) identified 12 team models that addressed forensic mental health, including interdisciplinary teams collaborating on prearrest, postbooking, and jail diversion; co-responding (law enforcement and mental health professionals address acute mental health crises simultaneously), information sharing agreements (e.g., sex offender registries), and reentry programs. Parker and colleagues’ review showed rich opportunity for adopting technology across these many aspects of forensic mental health. In the future, we may see a move away from using technology to mimic in-person care, and increased use of artificial intelligence, robotics, metrics and data mining, mobile apps, and virtual reality (Shore, 2019) in workflow and treatment configurations.As noted by Batastini et al. (2018), joint ventures between academic and community-based collaborators as resources can be helpful in implementing forensic e-mental health. There could be mutual needs across the university and forensic mental health community. Academic centers typically have strong information technology infrastructure and their research missions often involve meeting the needs of local communities; therefore, e-mental health, particularly for underserved populations such as individuals in the forensic realm, could fit nicely into their research agendas (Caudill & Sager, 2015). The University of Washington (UW) has implemented academic-community based partnerships specific to psychiatric e-mental health (Kimmel et al., 2019) and a forensic teaching service (Piel et al., 2019). In fact, following the landmark Trueblood v. State of Washington Department of Human and Social Services (2015), the 2016 Washington State Legislature directed UW, the state’s Department of Social and health Services, and state psychiatric hospital to develop a forensic teaching service with the goal of facilitating forensic psychiatry services in particular. In Texas, the University of Texas Medical Branch and Texas Tech University Health Services provide all psychiatric services via e-mental health for individuals incarcerated by the Texas Department of Criminal Justice (Raimer & Stobo, 2004). University-based forensic clinics simultaneously provide valuable training experience and contribution to the community (Heilbrun et al., 2013). A book on the ways universities can collaborate with criminal justice programming is forthcoming (Heilbrun et al., in press).There are others’ “lessons learned” that should be considered prior to embarking on new forensic e-mental health endeavors. In their reflection on the development of a psychiatry e-mental health program, Ulzen et al. (2013) delineated the successes and challenges of their collaboration between the University of Alabama School of Medicine–Tuscaloosa and a local nonprofit mental health clinic. For example, there may be unanticipated changes in leadership or institutional directions, which both have the potential to derail the e-mental health service agenda. The authors emphasized that enthusiasm and project advocacy was critical. In the earlier period of their collaboration, Alabama law indicated that to bill for services, a physician must be present at the hub and the remote site—which essentially negates the efficiency and cost savings of e-mental health. The group lobbied state legislature, and a new law was passed that allowed for billing if at least one Medicaid-eligible provider is present at the remote site.Training and EducationPsychology-law is a fast-growing area of clinical expertise, which can require training and education in assessment, intervention, and research across a range of settings (DeMatteo et al., 2019). Magaletta et al. (2013) surveyed 170 APA-accredited psychology doctoral programs and found that 111 (65%) offered experience in corrections, and a follow-up study showed that intervention comprised the majority of corrections practicum experience (Magaletta et al., 2017). The number of predoctoral psychology internships with correctional or forensic components have tripled over the last decade (Malesky & Croysdale, 2009; Potts et al., 2020). Forensic e-mental health provides a novel avenue for training and supervising students interested in this career trajectory. For example, trainees and supervisors can remotely coconduct forensic evaluations via three-way videoconference (M. A. Conroy, personal communication, May 15, 2020) and remote live supervision (i.e., the “bug in the ear” method of supervision) has long been an option (Rousmaniere, 2014). Interested readers can refer to McCord et al. (2015), who detailed their training protocol specific to counseling psychology doctoral students at Texas A&M University’s Telehealth Counseling Clinic. Psychiatry colleagues (Saeed et al., 2017) have also provided 12 guidelines for graduate medical education in telepsychiatry, including awareness of the remote location’s resources (e.g., local emergency room and coordinated care colleagues), understanding the laws and ethics related to e-mental health, recognizing when e-mental health practice is appropriate for a particular client, and considering issues of test integrity.Of course, training and education do not conclude with graduation. The University of New Mexico School of Medicine’s Law and Mental Health Lecture Series has offered free, weekly, 1-hr continuing education (CE) credit sessions since 2018 on psychology-law topics via Zoom videoconference and plans to continue this opportunity indefinitely (J. Brovko, personal communication, May 8, 2020). This is a generous online service afforded to the forensic practitioner community and serves as a model that can be replicated by other academic, clinical, and correctional institutions throughout the country. The Standards and Criteria for Approval of Sponsors of Continuing Education for Psychologists (APA, 2015) indicates that there are no fees for offering and granting CE credits; rather, CE “sponsors” must meet criteria outlined therein (see https://www.apa.org/about/policy/approval-standards.pdf). For practitioners in search of in-depth training on forensic topics, ConceptCE at Palo Alto University (https://concept.paloaltou.edu/) offers a host of synchronous and asynchronous continuing education training opportunities, ranging from one to 60-hr CE courses.Make Data Accessible for Researchers and PolicymakersA remarkable benefit of e-mental health is that in many cases, data can be automatically populated into electronic records and exported for statistical analyses. This offers exciting prospects for research across the sequential intercept model, that is, the many points individuals may enter or delve deeper into the criminal justice system and their opportunities for intervention (Munetz & Griffin, 2006). At the individual-evaluator level, several sources recommend evaluators track referral sources, case characteristics, and penultimate psycho-legal opinions in a personal database (Dror & Murrie, 2018; Gowensmith & McCallum, 2019; Guarnera et al., 2017). Gowensmith (2019a) expanded this idea when developing the mobile phone application called Case Rate (www.caserate.org), in which evaluators can input a variety of variables, calculate caseload-wide descriptive statistics, and compare their own case details to colleagues’ through its crowd-sourced data function. The app simplifies database maintenance given its mobile accessibility and is a novel usage of technology for data procurement, storage, and sharing, as well as monitoring potential evaluation biases.While criminal justice has a number of nationwide databases housing policing, correctional, and victimization statistics, there is little available specific to forensic mental health aside from specialty court data. We advocate for the development of forensic-specific electronic databases, developed for quality assurance and improvement rather than for specific research projects. This effort has been in place at the University of Virginia via its long-standing Forensic Evaluation Information System (Murrie et al., 2020; Warren et al., 1991) and more recent Custom Application Consulting Service (CACS; Warren, 2018). CACS consists of case management software specific to juvenile adjudicative competence. The paperless system allows for analysis of real-time service delivery data, calendar alerts for impending court deadlines, a streamlined progress note system, a searchable database for finding case-relevant data, management of billing and program costs, and production of administrative summary reports. Like Case Rate, CACS is moving toward a mobile phone app interface (Kois et al., 2019). More recent efforts include Quality Assurance and Quality Improvement databases such as the Alabama Forensic Assessment and Research Evaluation Project (Alabama FARE, Kois & Cox, 2020) and the patient research database at Massachusetts’ Bridgewater State Hospital (Fairfax-Columbo et al., 2020). These state-level projects are encouraging; however, bringing together national data through organized means will help us better understand epidemiology of mental health and criminogenic factors among forensic populations, as well as how to mitigate these factors.Researchers and policymakers should understand issues around confidentiality and privacy prior to data-sharing, as various entities (e.g., law enforcement, vs. corrections, vs. forensic hospitals) have very different HIPAA obligations (Petrila et al., 2015). Further, prior to practicing any form of e-mental health which includes the collection of client data, governing bodies should clearly outline data sharing and storage requirements. This includes directions for practitioners and researchers regarding efforts to protect against cyber-security attacks. It is promising that many licensing boards and professional organizations (e.g., APA) already offer guidance on data protection within cyberinfrastructure. However, considering technology and its application to the mental health field is constantly evolving, policymakers should remain diligent in updating data security recommendations and requirements.BarriersImplementing forensic e-mental health is easier said than done. The initial and most crucial hurdle is obtaining stakeholder buy-in. Although research consistently shows that e-mental health consumers perceive it as acceptable and feasible, practitioners tend to rate lower overall satisfaction with e-mental health relative to in-person format. A survey of substance use treatment providers found that nearly half were concerned that their staff would not accept the implementation of e-mental health use through mobile apps, phone, text message, instant message, videoconference, or web-based modules, but suspected that only one fifth of clients would not accept these e-interventions (Faragher et al., 2018). In their study of videoconference MacCAT-CA administration, Manguno-Mire et al. (2007) found that practitioners reported technological difficulties (i.e., wifi connectivity, audio/verbal lag, poor feedback, and audiovisual quality) as the most problematic issues. A survey of forensic practitioners noted ethical and legal concerns along with limitations in conducting psychological assessments via videoconference as most problematic (Batastini et al., 2019).If and when the time comes, large scale implementation of forensic e-mental health will require a significant culture shift within the scientific and clinical fields, as well as within institutions (i.e., psychiatric hospitals, correctional facilities, community supervision offices) that are, historically, slow to evolve. Eventual forensic e-mental health implementation will also require the support of state and local legislators who allocate funds for community mental health and correctional services. For institutions and organizations, forensic e-mental health would require significant upfront costs, which will take time to recoup. For example, Rappaport et al. (2018) examined the cost-savings of implementing telehealth (with a focus on primary and emergent care) throughout Maryland’s Department of Corrections and found that it took approximately 32 months for the program to regain its initial investment ($1.2 million). Despite this, there are reports of programs and institutions that have successfully lobbied for this support. For example, the mental health court/jail diversion system between Rikers Island and New York City Diversion Courts conducts virtually all violence risk assessments via videoconference (M. Rotter, personal communication, April 28, 2020). Of note, W. N. Gowensmith and D. Murrie (personal communication, May 9, 2020) reported that colleagues from Colorado’s Office of Behavioral Health secured funds for videoconference technology (including video-enabled mobile phones) for Colorado defendants undergoing inpatient and outpatient restoration in the context of COVID-19.We acknowledge forensic institutions are grossly under resourced and underfunded (Pinals, 2014), and the downward trajectory of funding for public mental health resources is unlikely to rebound given the near global economic devastation associated with COVID-19. We acknowledge financially struggling systems may have difficulty implementing programs requiring substantial upfront costs, particularly without assistance from local, state, and federal governments. Further, the cost-effectiveness of e-mental health programs is variable (Lal & Adair, 2014) and largely depends on the quality and extensiveness of implementation. When considering these financial barriers, institutions should consider whether the result justifies the (costly) means and what e-mental health program will be most efficacious given the priorities of the unit and the population being served.For practitioners working outside of a government funded system, the length of time needed to recoup the initial costs may be infeasible. Perhaps not surprisingly, practitioners have reported reimbursement as a reason for not adopting e-mental health in the past (Faragher et al., 2018). It is possible these practitioners may find value in “teaming up” with other practitioners to share initial costs, as some do when buying materials and renting space for independent practice. Despite the initial financial considerations, within a short period of time, forensic e-mental health can result in quantifiable, organizational-level cost saving, as well as less tangible improvement in public safety (Rappaport et al., 2018).A number of ethical considerations should be noted. It is critical to determine whether e-mental health is appropriate on an individual case basis, that is, according to the practitioner’s skill and the validity and reliability of the technology-assisted technique as applied to a given examinee (APA, 2013, 2017). Practitioners should reference relevant ethical codes to guide this decision-making process. During this unprecedented pandemic, emergency services are acceptable and encouraged; however, moving forward, it is imperative that advancements in practice and policy are proactive, evidence-based, and intentional rather than reactive.A final consideration is the differential access to the technological resources necessary for implementation. Recently highlighted by many school systems’ sudden transition to online education due to COVID-19 (Hall et al., 2020), across the country differential access to reliable Internet and digital devices exacerbates preexisting gaps between socioeconomic classes and largely impacts people of color and rural communities (Pew Research Center, 2019). If the cost of participation in forensic e-mental health is placed largely on the consumer, it is possible financial barriers could subsequently impair treatment performance. Relatedly, forensic e-mental health may not be appropriate for certain populations, such as older adults who may be less tech-savvy. As the field increasingly adopts this approach, it is imperative that policymakers, researchers, and clinicians consider accessibility and affordability (see Luxton et al., 2016).ConclusionThus far, forensic psychology falls steps behind the technological advancements of our medical, psychiatry, and counseling psychology colleagues. Research to date is largely focused on forensic e-mental health evaluation, specifically competency to proceed, and correctional interventions. There is ample opportunity to explore how technology can improve other evaluation and intervention practices. The world of technology is too vast for one article to cover every technological innovation that could be applied to forensic mental health. We did not report every study, nor did we address every area of forensic e-mental health that could benefit from technological means. Rather than a systematic review, this article is a beginning point for forensic mental health practitioners, researchers, and policymakers to gain exposure to which technologies are available, their evidence base, and what they may expect in the future.Necessity is the mother of invention. The COVID-19 pandemic presented unexpected changes to forensic mental health practice, research, and policy; however, it also has allowed for unparalleled advancements in how the forensic mental health field can leverage technology. Given its ease, accessibility, and widespread use during COVID-19, it is likely that forensic e-mental health will persist in many practice, research, and policy contexts once there is a (relative) “return to normal.” It is our hope that the COVID-19-necessaitated technology zeitgeist provides impetus for exciting innovations in the field of forensic psychology. In mid-March, 2020, the authors—as well as the majority of therapists—were advised to work from home rather than the office to help stop the spread of Covid-19. Thus, the Covid-19 pandemic began to shape a new personal and professional reality that specifically related to how therapists provide psychotherapy services. The uncertain duration of this new professional reality has constrained therapists in ways that no one could have predicted and has required significant adjustments to be made and creativity to be employed in terms of finding new ways to work remotely and effectively from home offices that were perhaps never originally intended to serve as therapeutic spaces.In this mixed-method study, we focused on assessing psychotherapists’ challenges providing psychotherapy services from home during the Covid-19 pandemic. We examined the specific adaptations participants implemented to improve their experiences and their clients’ experiences in the therapeutic relationship. This article offers readers an opportunity to learn about ways to overcome challenges while providing teletherapy from home. Finally, it offers participants’ perceptions about the possibility of returning to the office to see clients in person.Literature ReviewThere is ample research on effective remote psychotherapy. The results from some studies have shown that it can be as effective as in-person psychotherapy (Poletti et al., 2020; Roesler, 2017), such as the systematic reviews that have been done on videoconferencing as a psychotherapy tool (Backhaus et al., 2012; Shigekawa et al., 2018; Simpson, 2009). A body of empirical literature related to the delivery of remote psychotherapy from therapists’ homes is gradually developing. Evans et al. (2020) have focused on a new ethical conflict that has arisen in the field since the emergence of the Covid-19 pandemic. They have found that continuing to see clients face-to-face would put the lives of therapists and their patients at risk and would therefore be unethical, but terminating with clients during a global pandemic would not be best practice either. To mediate this conflict, many clinicians have chosen to continue providing treatment by working remotely.Békés and Aafjes-van Doorn (2020) surveyed 145 psychotherapists to collect their demographics and assess their attitudes toward online psychotherapy during the Covid-19 pandemic. The majority of the participants were women who resided in the United States and worked in independent practice. The participants were recruited via professional email lists, social media, and individual contacts. Most of the participants reported a somewhat positive attitude toward the transition to online psychotherapy during the pandemic. The results from this study showed that positive attitudes toward online psychotherapy were correlated with past positive experiences with providing remote services. Attitudes toward online psychotherapy were also influenced by the participants’ reports of feeling tired, less connected, and less authentic in sessions. Another important variable was the modality of treatment that the clinician used. Participants who utilized a cognitive–behavioral approach reported more positive attitudes toward online psychotherapy compared with those who used a primarily psychodynamic approach. The authors of the study speculated that this may have been due to the fact that psychodynamic therapy places a greater emphasis on the relational process as a mechanism of change—more so than other short-term modalities such as cognitive–behavioral therapy. This empirical study has made an important contribution as one of the very first to explore therapists’ attitudes toward their work during the pandemic.MacMullin et al. (2020) used the actor–network method, which is an approach to studying science and technology that focuses on the integration of networks (Latour, 2013), to qualitatively investigate psychotherapists’ experiences with online therapy. They conducted five semistructured interviews with Canadian psychotherapists who worked independent practice and found that the participants were comfortable with remote work and felt it was effective. However, they reported that the participants expressed some confusion about how to set boundaries with clients during the therapeutic interaction when providing online therapy and their ability to trust technology (the platform they used and Internet connection).Békés et al.’s (2020) survey on therapists’ experiences of practicing psychotherapy or psychoanalysis remotely during Covid-19 yielded similar results. The researchers recruited 190 therapists using professional listservs mainly from the fields of psychology, social work, and psychiatry. The majority of the participants were women who worked in independent practice and lived in the United States. The researchers found that the participants felt confident in their work with patients and were able to relate and stay emotionally connected and authentic during their online encounters. While their views on remote therapy were more positive during the pandemic than they were prepandemic, the majority of the participants still found in-person therapy to be more effective.Finally, Aafjes-van Doorn et al. (2020) studied levels of vicarious trauma among 339 therapists as a result of working with traumatized patients during the Covid-19 pandemic. The participants were psychotherapists who had seen at least one client in remote sessions since the pandemic started. Through the survey, the authors gathered demographic (personal and professional) information and asked questions about vicarious trauma that captured the participants’ experiences with the cumulative effects of empathic engagement with patients who have a history of trauma. The results from this study showed that 74.9% of the participants reported that they felt tired, and 47.8% reported that they had experienced having a hard time connecting to their client. On average, the therapists experienced moderate levels of vicarious trauma. Those who experienced a higher level were younger in age, had relatively less clinical experience, and had past negative experiences with remote treatment.MethodProcedureUpon receiving ethical approval from the Human Research and Ethics Committee of Long Island University (IRB Protocol 20/05–097), we recruited mental health professionals through dedicated and diverse professional listservs designed for social workers, psychologists, and art therapists. During the month of June 2020, we sent out a recruitment email that included a link to the survey. All participants signed an electronic informed consent form, which included a statement of ethics approval for the study as well as the goals of the research. Ninety-two therapists agreed to participate in an online survey that included demographic questions as well as questions about their perceptions of the therapeutic alliance and their professional and personal experiences providing remote treatment during the pandemic. For a detailed overview of the participants who participated in the survey, see Table 1.TABLES AND FIGUREStable/figure thumbnailTable 1. Descriptive Characteristics of the 92 TherapistsView larger image > in this page > in new window> Download slideAt the end of the online survey, the participants were given the option of participating in a semistructured interview (“Please provide your email address if you would like to schedule an interview of up to 45 minutes in length”). Each participant who provided their email address received a separate email in response. A total of 19 therapists agreed to participate in a telephone interview with the researchers.InstrumentFor the quantitative phase of the study, we developed an anonymous online survey with 55 questions to address the research questions. The survey was designed following the recent literature (Békés & Aafjes-van Doorn, 2020; Békés et al., 2020; MacMullin et al., 2020) and a content analysis of email messages posted on psychotherapy listservs. In the survey, we used Likert scale statements (e.g., strongly disagree, disagree, neutral, agree, and strongly agree) as options for answering the questions. Higher scores on each scale indicated greater agreement with the questions present in each scale. The survey included positively and negatively worded questions that were reversed during the analysis to increase consistency.For the qualitative phase of the study, we developed an interview guide with 15 questions that was based on the recent literature and empirical data on remote therapy during the pandemic (Békés & Aafjes-van Doorn, 2020; Békés et al., 2020; MacMullin et al., 2020). Phone interviews were conducted by the research team using a protocol that began by giving the participants an introduction to the study and was followed by asking the participants open-ended questions relating to their experiences of providing remote therapy during the pandemic. The next set of questions asked the participants to describe any changes they had observed in their relationships with their clients due to the transition to remote work. Finally, the participants were asked to share some examples of challenging moments that they had faced that would not have likely occurred had they been in their offices, as well as their thoughts and feelings about returning to in-person work.Data AnalysisProcedures for Analyzing the Quantitative DataStatistical Package for the Social Sciences (v. 27) was used to analyze the quantitative data. Reverse coding ensured that all the numerical scoring scales were in the same direction. The data were descriptively analyzed in order to demonstrate the shape, central tendency, and variability within the data set. The results section presents the valid percentage of the responses.Procedures for Analyzing the Qualitative DataA thematic analysis was undertaken (Braun & Clarke, 2006) to analyze the qualitative data. In this process, the recorded interviews were transcribed and read in order to identify concepts. After repeating these steps across all the transcripts, emerging codes and categories were compared by two reviewers (the authors), connected as appropriate, and organized into key concepts.ResultsThe majority of the participants self-identified as White women with an average age of 46.2 (SD = 18.02; range, 25–75). Of them, 80.5% (n = 74) had a social worker degree, 17.4% had a psychology degree (n = 16), and 2.1% had a counseling degree (n = 2). All of the participants had been seeing all or most of their clients face-to-face in their psychotherapy offices prior to the pandemic. The participants used both phone and online platforms, such as Zoom (n = 44, 47.8%) and Webex and Doxy (n = 23, 25%), a combination of a phone and online platform (n = 18, 19.6%), and other online platforms such as FaceTime, Skype, WhatsApp, and Google Meet (n = 7, 7.6%) to provide therapy.The results are divided into seven categories of challenges and outcomes that are “solutions” or adjustments that our participants found or made in order to cope with the difficulties they experienced because of the pandemic and the transition to remote work: (a) shared trauma, (b) adjustment without preparation, (c) psychotherapy with children, (d) Zoom fatigue, (e) lack of privacy, (f) psychotherapy with new clients, and (g) negotiating physical and relational space/re-creating boundaries. We conclude with some mixed-method data about the participants’ perceptions of transitioning back to the office in the future, which is a topic that is particularly salient to therapists given the current situation.Challenge 1: Shared TraumaChallengeThe majority of participants (60.8%, n = 56) found it difficult to help their clients cope with the trauma of the pandemic because they too were coping with their own trauma. Participant B.L. shared, “Some of my friends have died, which rocked me and made me extra sensitive.” Some participants reported that they had contracted the virus themselves and therefore had to prioritize their own health.It was inevitable that the emotional impact of the pandemic on the therapist would be a topic that would arise in sessions. Participant E.W. reported that her clients had requested more self-disclosure from her, and as a result, she felt she needed to be more revelatory about herself. The levels of stress and anxiety that participants experienced as a result of the pandemic have impacted their ability to offer the best care possible to their clients. In order to maintain the efficacy of their work throughout the crisis, it required greater personal and professional awareness on the part of clinicians.OutcomeDespite its challenges, the participants highlighted that the experience of shared trauma helped with the “bonding” process between them and their clients. Participant E.W. stated,I think it’s the closest in some ways that we get to a shared really challenging experience; some people have mentioned it even equalizes things a little bit because we’re all dealing with the same issue. This shared struggle . . . brings us closer.Participant M.K. agreed: “Some clients have asked about me for the first time ever. A little bit of self-disclosure is needed on the part of the therapist to bring them and clients closer.” She felt that her clients had begun to see her as “more human.” Similarly, Participant B.M. felt that the shared reality of the pandemic has been validating for some clients. “It levels the playing field. They are not alone in their anxiety . . . it’s like the world is resonating with them instead of them feeling out of step with the world.” The shared trauma, at least at the beginning of the pandemic, offered an example of how therapists go through the same experiences as their clients. This reality cannot be ignored, especially under the current circumstances.Challenge 2: Adjustment Without PreparationChallengeClinicians were forced to adapt to their new settings quickly. In our study, 69.6% of the participants (n = 64) agreed that conducting therapy remotely during the pandemic had been challenging for them. For some who had previous experience providing remote therapy, the transition had been easier. For most, regardless of their previous experience, the idea of working from home for an indeterminant amount of time seemed daunting. As a matter of fact, only 18.5% of the participants (n = 17) reported taking an online course/training in telehealth before or during the pandemic.For those participants who worked in institutional practices as opposed to private practices, the lack of regulations on the preferred Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)–compliant platforms through which to communicate with patients, access to medical records from personal computers, and the client’s ability to sign documents also made the transition more challenging. Participant U.G., who worked at an outpatient mental health clinic, explained, “There was a lot of confusion regarding procedures, which platforms were okay to use, how we do our notes and billing. There was a lot of panic, which made it very difficult.”OutcomeThe participants reported that it took them some time to adjust to providing consistent remote treatment. Some were reluctant at first, mainly because they had little experience using technology in their work. However, after an awkward start, they eventually became more comfortable, and using technology began to feel akin to seeing clients in the office. Nonetheless, 83.7% of the participants (n = 77) reported a notable difference between face-to-face therapy done in the office and remote therapy. Although the transition was rough for many at the beginning, clinicians eventually settled into the new routine and gained confidence in their ability to provide remote therapy. Consistent with other participants, Participant A.J. explained, “I didn’t expect it to be so easy and such a positive experience.” She had originally dreaded the transition, thinking that it would not be rewarding and assuming that it would be “terrible” and “ineffective.” She stated, “My view has changed . . . this has definitely opened up my mind toward the possibility that [remote therapy] can be workable, and for some people it’s more workable than face-to-face.”Challenge 3: Psychotherapy With ChildrenChallengeTherapists who worked with children found the transition to remote to be particularly difficult. “With the children, I think it’s just so much harder to build a therapeutic alliance. It just takes so much longer for them to get comfortable,” stated Participant A.L. “There are certain games we could play over Zoom, but it’s limited, and this is going on for so many months, so at a certain point, we kind of run out of things to play.” He noted that short attention spans, common among children, make it that much more challenging to engage them in play therapy online. Participant B.K. also found remote work with children to be challenging, mainly because it required tools that she did not have at hand, as work with this population is usually not reliant on talk therapy alone but required play therapy toys or art materials.OutcomeOvercoming the challenges relating to working therapeutically with children remotely required much more preparation, research, and adaptation in order for the remote therapy to be successful. Participant B.K. explained,Play therapy is much harder to do remotely. I had to find a virtual app to do this work, which has been a tremendous relief for them and me. The first time using it successfully with a client left me feeling elated.Therapists who worked with children have had to think more outside the box and be creative with their interventions. As part of their adaptations, participants mentioned using the share screen option on Zoom to play a game or to draw together.Challenge 4: Zoom FatigueChallengeAnother challenge reported by the participants in their adjustment process was experiencing “Zoom fatigue,” a term coined to describe the cumulative effects of using video platforms for extended periods each day (Reinach Wolf, 2020; Wiederhold, 2020). The participants in this study grew tired of staring at a screen for hours at a time each day, specifically at the beginning of the transition. Not being able to read their client’s full body language required therapists to compensate by paying especially close attention to what was in their view, such as observing eye contact or shifting in one’s seat. Participant B.M., a hospital social worker, explained, “I have to watch people’s faces a lot more. It’s hard because I have to be more present than in the room. . . . It’s more exhausting because your face is also on the screen.”“Zoom fatigue,” or “Zoom drain,” made the therapists’ days feel longer and required working harder to engage their clients. Participant M.K. described what they were missing when seeing clients through a camera: “Not to see full body presentations of clients, especially during intakes with new clients . . . you’re missing out on affect. Body language can tell a whole different story, so that’s definitely rough.” The participants explained that although they could not see their clients’ full bodies, they were able to see close-ups of their clients’ faces, which helped. Participant D.F. shared,I do not feel like I miss a lot of cues because I’m not seeing all of them; plus, in a way, the way Zoom works, you’re seeing them so close up it’s like you see every little flicker of the tiny muscles around their eyes in a way that you wouldn’t necessarily if they were sitting a normal sort of therapeutic distance from you.The camera view forced participants to be more attuned and to pay closer attention to their clients’ subtle nuances.OutcomeThe majority of our participants (89.1%, n = 82) found that having the support of their peers, supervision groups, families, and friends—as well as engaging in self-care practices, such as yoga and exercise—was extremely helpful in coping with the emotional and psychological effects of the pandemic, including Zoom fatigue. Some of the participants became involved in therapy groups online, which provided them with support and ideas and allowed them to connect with other clinicians. The participants who found remote work to be physically challenging as a result of sitting in front of a screen for many hours found it effective to spread their sessions out throughout the week instead of compressing them into 1 or 2 days a week. The participants reported that getting outside and taking walks in between sessions was helpful. One participant reported that she sometimes took naps in between sessions as a way to recharge and be more fully present with her clients. Participant Y.L. reported that she allowed herself a few minutes in between her sessions in order to ease some of the effects of Zoom fatigue.Challenge 5: Lack of PrivacyChallengeChallenge 5 is divided into two categories: (a) lack of privacy and (b) distraction. Sixty percent of the participants (n = 55) reported that they had some concerns about their clients’ privacy during therapy sessions. For example, Participant G.D. explained, “My young clients, whose family members [are] in the other room, do not feel so comfortable speaking and [have] asked me many times when can we meet in person in the office.” The participants have found the lack of privacy during remote sessions to be a significant barrier. For clients living in small, crowded spaces without access to headphones, and for children with intrusive parents, disclosure became more difficult.In addition, the participants described struggling with paying attention due to multiple distractions in the new setup, with 84.8% of participants (n = 78) reporting that they noticed when their clients became distracted during a session. In working from home, therapists have not only had to adjust to working with clients over a screen but have also had to cope with challenges that they would not likely encounter in the office. For example, the participants shared how their pets, partners, and children indirectly became part of the sessions. Participant W.S. shared one embarrassing moment that also impacted privacy: “My husband mixed up my schedule and showed up in the room during a session; I had to shoo him away without the client knowing.” Similarly, Participant S.D. explained, “My dog tends to bark at people walking by the house, so my clients have gotten to know my dog pretty well. I think it does make me seem a little bit more relatable.” In another scenario, Participant M.L. shared, “Clients get to meet my cats, which has brought up a range of reactions.”Another distraction that impacted remote work from home related to technology, for example, technological issues such as a poor Internet connection, incoming phone calls, or message notifications. Most participants agreed that choppy Wi-Fi created a lot of disruption and sometimes even stress. Participant L.T. explained, “When Zoom freezes, it’s so frustrating and interrupts the flow.” Such occurrences required participants to ask their clients to repeat what they had just shared, which affected their emotional expressions as a result and amounted to a significant disruption in the therapeutic work.OutcomeIn order to overcome privacy issues, 68.5% of the participants reported having conversations surrounding privacy (n = 63). Ninety-two percent of the participants (n = 85) used a HIPAA-compliant telehealth platform in order to protect their clients’ privacy and legally adhere to the HIPAA rules (e.g., use of approved telehealth platforms such as Zoom). When the problem of privacy was related to the client’s physical space, the therapist prompted the client to find a solution. Participant G.D. explained, “I asked her [the client] if we should change the time of the session so her parents are not home. In another case, I encouraged the client to speak about privacy with her parents.”Change of the physical setting was adapted by some of the participants. Participant L.K. suggested that clinicians ask themselves, “What do I look like to my clients? What are they seeing on their screen?” She consulted with an interior designer for tips on setting up her home workspace to look as much like her office as possible. She experimented with different lighting, backgrounds, and placements of the camera. Now, when she conducts remote sessions, she sits at her desk with an empty couch behind her so there is nothing personal on display except “maybe a candle and a lamp to warm up the room.” Similarly, Participant M.C. had to create a setup for herself that was more conducive to providing therapy, such as angling the camera so she was not displaying her entire living room but rather only a part of the wall (on which she added a few postcards for a bit of color) and a bookshelf. This felt more conducive to providing therapy by minimizing unnecessary self-disclosure and other distractions.According to the participants, their patients also found many creative ways to work around these obstacles, such as getting a noise-cancelling machine, going to the park, or sitting in their cars in order to gain a sense of privacy during sessions. This enabled them to continue sharing and growing as they had before the pandemic and the transition to remote work. Participant A.F., who works with children, gave an example of a client who wanted to talk about his confusion around his sexuality. However, living in a small apartment with several family members around meant that he was not comfortable verbalizing his feelings due to the risk of being overheard. To remedy this, the participant encouraged the client to type his thoughts in a chat box instead, because “typing felt much more safe [for the child].”Challenge 6: Psychotherapy With New ClientsChallengeBeginning a therapeutic relationship with a new client proved challenging for many of our participants. Seventy-four percent of the participants (n = 68) began working with new clients remotely during the pandemic. Participant E.W. explained, “There definitely feels like a disconnect, not seeing them in person. Especially since some of them don’t even want to do [video], so we’ve only done phone sessions, so I can’t even put a face to the name.” The participants reported that it was harder to build trust, make full assessments, establish appropriate goals, and form working alliances with their new clients over the phone or video. This was mainly related to the fact that the remote work created a sense of distance and detachment, which presented a challenge for the participants in establishing the therapeutic frame necessary to deepen the therapeutic process.Some of the participants discussed the bureaucratic issues that accompanied making the transition to remote work, such as navigating paperwork. Participant M.B. explained,I had to adjust to the opening paperwork because I had a really nice way of introducing it in a first session in person. I found a way that is minimally daunting for them, but that’s the main piece that feels different. Once the session is started, it has been smooth since everyone is used to video these days.Therefore, routine initial interactions and processes in the office setting have had to be adapted to accommodate the remote setting as therapists have taken on new clients during the pandemic.OutcomeWhile it was initially more challenging for many of the therapists surveyed to build rapport with new clients and understand the presenting problems, the participants also reported becoming more comfortable over the course of time to engage with clients remotely—especially if the sessions were conducted over a video platform as opposed to on the phone. It became easier when they found ways to introduce clients to the therapeutic frame, send intake forms via email, and speak with their clients about the challenges that come with remote treatment. It was a learning curve for both clients and therapists alike, which furthered the sense of connectedness. Sharing the feeling that they were “all in this together” was helpful for the participants as they built rapport with their new clients.Challenge 7: Negotiating Physical and Relational Space: Re-creating BoundariesChallengeThe change in the physical therapeutic space was one of the most immediate adjustments that therapists who transitioned to remote work during the pandemic were forced to make. For most participants, this transition felt like “new territory” because there were no clear guidelines on how to conduct therapy remotely from home. For example, which platform was the best to use? Should the therapist call the client or vice versa? Was there a designated space where the therapist and the client should sit during sessions? How should disturbing background noises be dealt with? How does the therapeutic hour start? Things that seemed to be self-evident in the office environment suddenly became less so over the computer.The transition to remote work introduced a relational challenge into the work as the use of a remote platform created an inherent distance between the therapist and the client. The safe holding environment of the therapist’s office was no longer there to support the clients. Participant B.K. explained that the dramatic change in the therapeutic space became a transferential issue, stating that for some clients,It’s been harder to explore because it’s a little bit of a reality piece because when such issues have come up in their treatment in the past, you can sort of be like “Look, I’m here, so let’s talk about why it feels to you like I’m not,” but now, working remotely, I’m here but I’m not here.Moreover, Participant B.M. explained one particular downside of practicing in a remote setting: “Clients are no longer able to sit in my safe space that I have for them in my office, which was very much an extension of me, really.”The participants also discussed the complexity of seeing their clients in their clients’ own homes. For some of the participants, it was advantageous to gain a literal peek into their clients’ worlds—unfiltered and in the absolute here and now. Participant M.C. described one striking example of a session in which her patient was cooking and brandishing a knife while she was talking about her partner. This act, needless to say, would not have taken place in the traditional office setting. It did, however, allow them an opportunity to explore clients’ feelings that perhaps would have not come up otherwise. Witnessing patients interact with the people—and things—in their homes offered the participants insights that simply would not have come across through talk therapy done in an office setting; therefore, it uniquely benefited the progression and depth of the work.OutcomeThe participants had to consider how the physical distance and lack of a shared space influenced the therapeutic relationship. Only 17.3% of the participants (n = 16) felt that the process of engaging clients remotely was similar to engaging clients in the office. Seventy-four percent of the participants (n = 68) reported that much more effort was required of them in order to build or maintain the therapeutic working alliance. The change in setting required them to have new types of discussions with their clients surrounding boundaries. Eighty-eight percent of the participants reported speaking with clients about their thoughts and feelings regarding the transition, which, to participants, felt like “new territory.” Many of these challenges were mediated by “learning on the go” and adapting and changing according to the participant’s positive/negative experiences. While not ideal, the participants all found ways to manage and move forward.Some participants thought that for many of their clients, being at home proved beneficial to the therapeutic work; the clients appeared to feel freer and more relaxed by engaging in therapy from the comfort of their homes in their own territories. Participant M.T.W. explained that therapy from the client’s own personal space offers them some added comfort, both physically and emotionally:I think the advantage is that these patients who suffer from complex trauma or are highly reactive—[who are now engaging in therapy from] the safety of home—is that if at any time during the session they find themselves feeling overwhelmed, then it’s perfectly acceptable to say that’s enough for today . . . and I think that having the freedom to disengage during the session has been helpful to these patients.In some cases, meeting remotely from their own personal spaces also allowed clients to go deeper with the work. As noted by Participant E.M., a trauma specialist,In-person intimacy of therapy can feel really overwhelming and the benefit of just them being able to be in their own space in the safety of their own apartment or house and then just the distance of the virtual sessions gives that little bit of space so that it’s not so overwhelming.Regarding therapy conducted over the phone that omits any visual element, Participant B.K. stated, “Clients don’t worry as much about my reactions and therefore feel freer to go deeper. It’s easier to bring up intense, scary feelings. It reproduces the analytic couch experience.” The majority of participants agreed that although the initial transition was challenging, once they found their footing, the work tended to go more smoothly.Moving ForwardThe participants were asked about their plans to return to the office to see their clients in person again. Although the desire to return to in-person sessions was common among the participants, they were also fine with continuing to work remotely until the office is a safe space to meet again. In fact, 71% of the participants would not mind continuing to see their clients remotely (n = 65).An overwhelming majority of the participants interviewed (n = 16) made it clear that if the choice were between returning to in-person sessions with a mask or other barrier or continuing to work remotely, they would without a doubt choose the latter. As Participant L.K. explained, “It’s a conundrum. I would like to be back, but then we would have to talk through a mask. What would that do? What kind of barrier will that pose? Our voices will be muffled.” Participant M.C. agreed because she enjoyed working remotely: “It takes discipline. Going back to a small office, in full PPE, an N95 face mask, going into therapy with someone who looks like they’re going into surgery. If that’s the case, I’d rather work remotely.” To add to that narrative, 55.4% of participants were sure that they would only see clients face-to-face once there was a vaccine to protect against Covid-19 (n = 51).Despite the challenges that the participants have faced by conducting remote therapy from their personal spaces, they have found working from home to offer a satisfactory solution to overcoming the problems created by Covid-19. On the whole, they felt that the advantages of working in this manner outweighed its challenges, and some have considered continuing to work remotely indefinitely.DiscussionMost likely, engaging in remote therapy from one’s personal space will continue beyond the duration of the pandemic and will become the new normal for clinicians and clients alike. Our study’s results show that therapists have been able to handle the transition to remote psychotherapy from home successfully. Our participants were able to find their own ways of coping with the transition while ensuring that their clients’ needs were prioritized. Nevertheless, there are still obstacles that should be addressed in relation to HIPAA law, confidentiality, privacy, and technology interruptions.The data analysis revealed heterogeneity in the provision of remote therapy. For example, the platform used for online sessions varied from one therapist to another, as did the device that was used; some therapists chose to begin the session by calling the client (opening the door), while others had the clients call them (client knocking on the door). Because of these and other variables, we argue that it is essential to create professional standards for providing remote therapy, particularly when it is conducted outside of the office space. While the American Psychiatric Association has collaborated with the American Telemedicine Association (American Psychiatric Association & American Telemedicine Association, 2018) to create guidelines for best practices in offering videoconferencing-based telemental health (Shore et al., 2018), these remain insufficient specifically because home is the new office. Publishing additional guidelines specific to providing remote therapy during a pandemic, as well as the preferred methods for its delivery, would prove highly supportive to both senior and junior clinicians in their work.Since our personal spaces now function as our new workspaces, not only has the physical boundary between work and home been lost, but for many, so too has the psychological boundary. This lack of separation between their work life and their personal life has sabotaged therapists’ ability to process and “decompress” in between or after sessions and made it difficult to establish boundaries. Thus, greater attention should be paid to the heightened risk of burnout and compassion fatigue among therapists due to the lack of physical and psychological separation between work and home.LimitationsOne of the limitations of this study is the fact that the sample was a convenience sample. The majority of the participants were social workers in independent practice in New York and New Jersey. As a result, the sample lacks the randomization and accuracy that is so important when conducting research. Moreover, the analysis failed to include variation between groups. Specifically, since close to 40% of the sample was aged 60 and above, there may have been differentiation in the participants’ experiences based on their age and familiarity with technology.Given that the majority of the participants in this study were social workers, future studies could consider how the pandemic has affected clinicians from other disciplines as well, specifically psychologists and psychiatrists. The anecdotal evidence shows that the experience has been similar (Békés et al., 2020; Callahan, 2020; Inchausti et al., 2020), but nevertheless, there is room to replicate this study with a disciplinarily heterogeneous population.Finally, the survey was limited in its ability to cover questions related to the confidentiality and privacy of the therapists and their clients. Maintaining confidentiality is a crucial part of the therapeutic relationship and likely jeopardized when home becomes the office and clients are deprived of access to a safe therapeutic space. Thus, further research is needed on how conducting therapy from home affects privacy and confidentiality.Implications for the Future of Psychotherapy Post-Covid-19One of the most important findings of our study is that as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, therapists, clients, managed care companies, and other significant stakeholders have been given the chance to learn that teletherapy is not only possible but also necessary. Few of the participants had received training on how to conduct therapy outside of the office during a pandemic. We recommend implementing a curriculum for students as well as clinicians that offers tools for providing effective remote therapy, specifically when it is conducted by therapists working from home. This is especially critical because Covid-19 is now our new reality, and it will likely take some time to return to what was once the normal way of working face-to-face in an office setting. We believe that such training will facilitate the work for clinicians, improve the therapeutic connection, and, most important, create professional standards for this new way of working.The results of this study also revealed different sets of challenges for therapists working with children as opposed to adults. Not being in the same physical space or having access to the games, toys, and other such tools that are essential to play therapy proved especially challenging. It required therapists to prepare for sessions by doing research in advance to find creative ways of keeping young clients engaged through play. We recommend conducting a study of the experiences of therapists who work remotely with children in order to determine what therapists have found to be most effective for maintaining the therapeutic alliance and ensuring that the quality of their work is on par with working face-to-face in the office.Finally, there is a great need to probe the possibility of making the transition back to the office and seeing clients in the office safely by relying on masks or social distancing techniques. The potential challenges related to this topic were briefly covered by the participants in this study, but it was not the main focus of the research. We believe that more information needs to be gathered in order to smooth the transition and really learn how to do it effectively.ConclusionThe learning curve for therapists conducting therapy remotely from home during a global pandemic has been steep. Mere months ago, we believed that it would just be a matter of time before we returned to “normal.” Now we understand that life with Covid-19 is the new normal. Consequently, remote therapy will remain a common method of work and perhaps even become the preferred method. Therefore, therapists will need to learn how to balance their personal and professional lives better and manage their screen time to prevent Zoom fatigue and burnout. Overall, our results show that, during the rapid transition to provide teletherapy from home due to the Covid-19 pandemic, therapists experienced some challenges related to their relationships with their clients, technology, and privacy. However, they were able to find solutions to keep their therapeutic relationships with their clients professional and beneficial. Further research and training are needed to help therapists develop best practices to more effectively build and maintain alliances with their clients when they are not in the same physical space. In early January of 2020, Chinese health authorities notified the World Health Organization (WHO) that a new type of coronavirus (COVID-19) had been identified as the cause of an outbreak of respiratory infections in Wuhan City, China. By mid-January, nearly 300 cases of the new virus had been diagnosed across China, Japan, Korea, and Thailand (WHO, 2020a). Confirmed cases of COVID-19 quickly swelled to more than 85,000 by the end of February (WHO 2020b), and by mid-March WHO declared COVID-19 to be a pandemic, with nearly 120,000 people testing positive worldwide (WHO, 2020d). In response to the rapid spread of the virus, WHO recommended that people take precautionary measures such as maintaining physical distance to reduce the risk of interpersonal transmission (WHO, 2020c), and governments, institutions, and businesses in the United States moved to online models for conducting their daily activities whenever possible (Adalja, Toner, & Inglesby, 2020).In anticipation of the possibility that the health care infrastructure could become overwhelmed, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and the American College of Surgeons (ACS) recommended that in-person routine health care visits and elective medical procedures be postponed (ACS, 2020; CDC, 2020b). Large health care organizations such as the Veterans Health Administration (VHA), Mayo Clinic Health System, and Johns Hopkins Medicine shifted toward utilizing telehealth services to meet patient needs while lessening interpatient and staff transmission risk and conserving medical supplies (Nitkin, 2020; Stiepan, 2020; VHA, Office of Emergency Management, 2020). Reports from the Chinese scientific community showed that ambiguity around COVID-19 contagiousness, prevalence, and risk, as well as mandated social isolation, have been associated with spikes in levels of anxiety, panic disorder, and depression in the general population (Qiu et al., 2020). For patients already receiving mental health care services, many original presenting problems have been overshadowed by increased fear, depression, anxiety, and panic (Perrin, Rybarczyk, et al., 2020). Public access to nonstop media coverage of the pandemic as well as exposure to social media may also have implications for increased mental health concerns (Gao et al., 2020; McDonnell, Nelson, & Schunk, 2012; United States Department of Health and Human Services Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, 2014). Furthermore, fundamental coping strategies like seeking social support to improve mental health (e.g., Harandi, Taghinasab, & Nayeri, 2017) through gathering with friends and family and at places of worship have suddenly become unavailable.Efforts to meet the health needs of new and established patients have required unprecedented measures by government agencies and other public and private systems, institutions, and companies. Since the VHA is an example of an integrated federal health system which had already been implementing and developing telepsychology prior to COVID-19, many of the barriers faced by psychologists outside the VHA system have been addressed, and its system may serve as an exemplar of how to deploy telepsychology (Perrin, Pierce, & Elliott, 2020). For example, online trainings with experienced trainers are already accessible to all providers (Caver et al., 2020). As veterans being served by the VHA are prequalified for services, reimbursement questions are largely nonexistent. Interstate practice within the VHA system is allowed, removing another external barrier to providing telepsychological services.In the VHA and more broadly, Medicare temporarily relaxed reimbursement restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic and allowed reimbursement for telemedicine visits at the same rate as in-person visits (United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services [CMS], 2020). Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) regulations were eased by the United States Department of Health and Human Services’ (HHS) Office for Civil Rights (OCR) to allow use of telecommunication apps like Skype, FaceTime, and Zoom (OCR, 2020a, 2020b). HHS also published waivers allowing telehealth providers participating in Medicare, Medicaid, and the Children’s Health Insurance Program to be reimbursed for visits with patients in states they were not currently licensed within (HHS, 2020). Furthermore, in response to declarations of emergency, psychology boards in several states including Arizona, California, and Texas suspended typical interjurisdictional requirements to allow psychologists not licensed within their state to provide treatment in their jurisdiction (California Board of Psychology, 2020; State of Arizona Board of Psychologist Examiners, 2020; Texas State Board of Examiners of Psychologists, 2020).Many professional psychology training programs and clinics moved rapidly to telepsychology with tele-supervision (e.g., Perrin, Rybarczyk, et al., 2020), and the Association of Psychology Postdoctoral and Internship Centers (APPIC) facilitated this, communicating that training hours via telepsychology could be counted the same as in-person (APPIC, 2020). Training programs were established through organizations such as the TeleBehavioral Health Institute (2020), and the American Psychological Association (APA) developed tools and resources to aid psychologists in their adoption of telepsychology (e.g., APA, 2020; Martin, Millán, & Campbell, 2020). Psychology organizations around the world, such as the European Federation of Psychologists’ Associations (EFPA) and the Australian Psychological Society (APS), also quickly developed resources for not only their members, but also consumers so they, too, could become accustomed to the idea of using telepsychology for their therapy (APS, 2020; EFPA, 2020).Pre-COVID-19 State of TelepsychologyTelepsychology, according to the APA, is the use of any of a number of telecommunication technologies to deliver psychological services (APA, 2015). Therefore, telepsychological services may run the gamut from smartphone apps meant to enhance treatment adherence (Reger et al., 2013) to Internet-based self-management tools for individuals with depression (Görges, Oehler, von Hirschhausen, Hegerl, & Rummel-Kluge, 2020) and other extensions of in-person services (Heesacker, Perez, Quinn, & Benton, 2020), to synchronous provision of audiovisual telepsychotherapy (Adler, Pritchett, Kauth, & Nadorff, 2014). Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, telepsychology was being used but in a limited capacity. Despite the availability of the technology for some time and the findings that for many psychological issues telepsychology is just as effective as in-person sessions (Varker, Brand, Ward, Terhaag, & Phelps, 2019), many psychologists had been slow to adopt telepsychology as a substantial part of their practice. Previous national-level research suggested that only about 21% of psychologists used telepsychology in their clinical practice (Pierce, Perrin, & McDonald, 2020b). An exception to this may be psychologists in the VHA, which was an early mover in telehealth and provided nearly 100,000 patients with telehealth services between 2006 and 2010 (Godleski, Darkins, & Peters, 2012). The VHA had been promoting the use of telepsychology as a way to reach veterans who would otherwise have limited access to mental health services because of geographic distance (Adler et al., 2014) and to reduce the length and frequency of psychiatric admissions (Godleski et al., 2012).Pre-COVID-19 Barriers to TelepsychologyAs telepsychology has been shown to be efficacious (Varker et al., 2019) and efficient (e.g., Adler et al., 2014; Darkins, 2016; Tadmor, McManus, & Koenig, 2006), one might wonder why it was not being utilized more extensively before the COVID-19 pandemic. A number of intrapsychic and environmental barriers to the adoption of telepsychology by psychologists have been identified. For example, many psychologists seemed to have doubts regarding the ease of using telepsychology in practice, as well as how useful it might be (Pierce et al., 2020b). Additionally, despite acknowledging its potential usefulness for therapy, approximately 75% of psychologists and other allied providers said they were not willing to refer their clients for telepsychology (Perle, Burt, & Higgins, 2014). When investigated further, a lack of self-efficacy has been evident in psychologists’ reasons for not utilizing telepsychology in their practices, as many cited insufficient opportunities for training as a major stumbling block in their willingness to go forward with telepsychology in their practices (Perry, Gold, & Shearer, 2020).In addition to intrapsychic barriers like bias and low self-efficacy, there have been many environmental barriers for those desiring to implement telepsychology. One example of an obstacle is federal security laws such as HIPAA. While enacted to protect patient privacy, in effect it limited options for telepsychology, as it precluded the use of common telecommunication applications like Skype and Facetime for the provision of telepsychology (APA, 2014). Medicare regulations are another example, as they laid out specific reimbursement qualification stipulations for telehealth sessions. For example, prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, patients were required to be in a Medicare-designated rural area and at a Medicare-specified medical treatment center in order for practitioners to receive reimbursement from Medicare for telemedicine visits. Accordingly, the American Medical Association reported that only .25% of Medicare patients received telehealth treatment (O’Reilly, 2019). State laws and regulations have also been limiters in the adoption of telepsychology; for example, most states require that the psychologist be licensed in the same state both they and the client are in at the time of treatment. Apart from legal regulations, the settings in which psychologists practice may restrict the implementation of telepsychology (Pierce, Perrin, & McDonald, 2020a) because policies and guidance on implementation are nonexistent, or there is no appropriate equipment or space available. Even when clinical settings have procured the necessary technology, technical issues on either the clinician’s or patient’s end can hinder willingness to use telepsychology.Current StudyThe flexibility and adaptability of telehealth and telepsychology services have been touted as an important part of crisis response plans, as telehealth allows professionals to provide services to hot zones rapidly or without having to be there in person at all (Darkins, 2016; Tadmor et al., 2006). This allows for efficient deployment of services when and where they are needed. The use of technology to conduct remote telepsychology sessions has very likely become more widespread because of the mandated social distancing imposed by authorities in an effort to reduce the transmission of COVID-19. The pandemic has even coincided with what some have called a “telemedicine revolution” (Perrin, Pierce, et al., 2020, p. 1), although no research to date has examined precisely how the use of telepsychology by psychologists has changed during the pandemic, nor what variables may account for the change in use. As a result, the purpose of this study was to examine (a) the amount of psychologists’ telepsychology use before the COVID-19 pandemic, during the pandemic, and anticipated use after the pandemic; as well as (b) the demographic, training, policy, and clinical practice predictors of these changes. To remain consistent with Medicare’s expanded definition during the pandemic, within the current study, “telepsychology” was defined as “the use of real-time audio (e.g., telephone) and/or video conferencing technology to provide psychological services.” It was hypothesized that telepsychology use would increase dramatically during the pandemic relative to before the pandemic, and that this increase in use would lead psychologists to anticipate continuing to use telepsychology at higher rates after the pandemic relative to baseline, though less than during the pandemic. The results of a previous study (Pierce et al., 2020a) suggested that age, gender, race/ethnicity, supportive policies, receiving training, and population density accounted for 29.8% of the variance in psychologists’ telepsychology use. The results also indicated that setting and treatment focus accounted for 5.3% and 13.1% (respectively) of the variance. These findings informed the variables chosen as predictors in the current study.MethodParticipantsPotential psychologist participants were recruited using e-mail addresses from directories of professional organizations, counseling center and mental health clinic websites, and psychology newsgroups. Eligibility requirements were that participants had to be: (a) licensed to practice as a psychologist in the United States, (b) age 18 or older, and (c) currently practicing (seeing patients) as a psychologist in the United States. Data were collected from May 11, 2020, to May 25, 2020. Initial and follow-up e-mail invitations were sent to 27,324 individuals, 3,897 of which were returned as “undeliverable,” and resulting in 3,694 participants who opened the survey. Of this number, 184 participants left after viewing the information sheet or indicated their refusal to provide informed consent, while 541 participants abandoned the survey at various points without completing it. Among the remainder, 198 individuals were not eligible to participate because they were not currently licensed or treating patients, and 127 were not included after refusing to answer demographic questions (e.g., age, years in practice). Finally, 25 participants’ data were excluded from analysis after they provided nonsensical responses to the validity check question (“In one sentence or less, what do you think the purpose of this study was?”), years of practice being equal to or less than the participant’s reported age, or years of practice reported indicating the psychologist started practicing prior to age 18. These exclusions resulted in a final sample of 2,619 licensed, currently practicing psychologists and an 11.18% completed response rate.Psychologists in this sample had an average age of 57.29 years with 35.4% identifying as men and 64.2% as women. These closely resembled APA membership demographics (57.8 years, 41.4% men, and 57.8% women; APA, 2018). The average number of years in practice was 24.22, with most individuals having an individual practice (54.4%) in a suburban (46.9%) or urban (43.9%) setting. Full sample demographics appear in Table 1.TABLES AND FIGUREStable/figure thumbnailTable 1. Summary of Participant CharacteristicsView larger image > in this page > in new window> Download slideMeasuresIn addition to demographic data about themselves, their practice location and setting, and treatment foci, participants were asked to provide responses regarding their telepsychology use, training, and organizational policies relative to January 20, 2020, when the first COVID-19 case was confirmed in the United States. Medicaid and Medicare define “telemedicine” as “two-way, real time interactive communication between the patient, and the physician or practitioner at the distant site” (United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, 2019). Medicare also makes further distinction between telehealth visits which they specify use audio and video communication between the provider and the patient. Communication using telephone only is termed a “virtual check-in” (United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, 2020). The United States Drug Enforcement Administration limits this definition of telemedicine even further to only include health care facilitated by real-time, two-way, audio/video interactions between the practitioner and their patients (United States Drug Enforcement Administration Diversion Control Division, 2019). To remain consistent with this trend and, in particular, the expansion of telepsychology reimbursement during the pandemic under Medicare, telepsychology was defined to participants as the use of real-time audio (e.g., telephone) and/or video conferencing technology to provide psychological services.The researcher-generated telepsychology questions used were: (a) “What percentage of your patient treatment is provided using telepsychology?” with answers ranging from 0%-100%; (b) “I have been trained well to use telepsychology,” with a 7-point, Likert-type scale ranging from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 7 (Strongly Agree); and (c) “My organizational policies support telepsychology,” measured on the same Likert-type scale. For all three questions, participants responded three times with regard to the following prompts: (a) “Before the COVID-19 pandemic began in the U.S. on January 20, 2020”; (b) “During the COVID-19 pandemic in the U.S.”; and (c) “Your anticipated perspective or behaviors after the COVID-19 pandemic ends in the U.S.” The amount of change for the current primary analyses was determined by subtracting participants’ responses about their telepsychology use before the pandemic from their answers during the pandemic.ProcedurePotential participants were sent a recruitment e-mail inviting them to complete a 10-min survey that would “help inform treatment approaches used during the pandemic, as well as public healthcare policy.” To avoid biasing enrollment based on preconceived notions of telepsychology, no reference to telepsychology was made in the recruitment e-mail. Additionally, all potential participants received a reminder e-mail one week after the initial invitation was sent. If the providers elected to participate, they had to agree to an informed consent document before being directed to the Qualtrics web platform and screened for eligibility. Participants completed a number of demographic questions about themselves and their practice, read the telepsychology definition used in this survey, and then answered the questions about telepsychology.Data AnalysisAll analyses were conducted using SPSS (Version 26.0). Significance was established at an alpha level of .05, two-tailed. A repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was conducted in which the predictor variable was time (3 levels: before the COVID-19 pandemic, during the pandemic, and projected after the pandemic), and the criterion variable was percentage of clinical work performed via telepsychology.Then, four ANOVAs were conducted examining the effects of primary treatment setting on (a) prepandemic percentage of clinical work performed via telepsychology, (b) that percentage during pandemic, (c) that percentage projected after the pandemic, and (d) change from percentage of clinical work performed via telepsychology before the pandemic to the percentage during the pandemic. These ANOVAs included only participants who worked in primary treatment settings selected by 25 or more participants, and participants who chose the “other” designation were excluded. For these four ANOVAs only, this resulted in not including participants who worked in correctional facilities, geriatric facilities, psychiatric hospitals, rehabilitation centers, residential treatment centers, or other practice settings.Finally, two multiple regression analyses were conducted to examine the statistical effects of (a) participant demographics, change in workplace telepsychology policy, change in telepsychology training, practice geographic area, and (b) treatment focus on the change in the percentage of clinical work conducted via telepsychology before relative to during the COVID-19 pandemic. In both regressions, the criterion variable was the percentage of clinical work conducted via telepsychology during the pandemic minus the percentage conducted via telepsychology before the pandemic. The first model’s predictors included age, gender (1 = woman, 0 = man or transgender or nonbinary), race/ethnicity (1 = White/European American, 0 = racial/ethnic minority), the relative change in perceived organizational support via telepsychology policies, relative change in perceived levels of telepsychology training received, and the geographic area type where the practice was located (1 = rural vs. 0 = urban or suburban). The second model’s predictors included dummy-coded variables representing a variety of issues and diagnoses the psychologists’ treated within their practice.ResultsChanges in Telepsychology Use Over TimeThe repeated-measures ANOVA examining the effects of time on the percentage of clinical work performed via telepsychology was statistically significant, F(2, 2617) = 8254.01, p < .001, partial eta-squared = .863, a very large-sized effect. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, psychologists performed 7.07% (SD = 14.86) of their clinical work with telepsychology, 85.53% (SD = 29.24) during the pandemic, and a projected 34.96% (SD = 28.35) after the pandemic. These changes represent a more than 12-fold increase in percentage telepsychology use during the pandemic relative to before the pandemic.Additionally, 45.70% of psychologists reported not using telepsychology at all before the pandemic, with 84.99% reporting using it for 0–10% of their clinical work. Conversely, during the pandemic, 96.45% of psychologists reported using telepsychology in their practice, with 6.61% reporting using it for 0–10% of their clinical work; 67.32% of psychologists reported going completely virtual during the pandemic, with 77.63% reporting using telepsychology for 90–100% of their clinical practice. After the pandemic, 89.19% of psychologists anticipated using telepsychology in their clinical practice (though at just over one third of clinical work).Primary Practice SettingThe results of the series of one-way ANOVAs comparing the percentage of telepsychology use and change in that percentage by psychologists’ primary practice settings appear in Table 2.TABLES AND FIGUREStable/figure thumbnailTable 2. Percentage Use of Telepsychology by Primary Practice SettingView larger image > in this page > in new window> Download slideBefore the COVID-19 pandemic, psychologists in Veterans Affairs (VA) medical centers and individual practices had the highest percentage use of telepsychology. Psychologists in outpatient treatment facilities and academic medical centers reported the lowest. During the pandemic, psychologists in group and individual practices had the highest percentage use, although that use was only higher than the lowest percentage group, psychologists in a hospital/medical practice. The largest increase in percentage telepsychology use during the pandemic occurred in group practice, particularly relative to the low percentage increases in hospital/medical practice and VA medical centers. However, in terms of fold increase, psychologists in outpatient treatment facilities reported over a 26-fold increase, followed by psychologists in an academic medical center who reported over a 23-fold increase; by contrast, psychologists in VA medical centers only reported just over a sevenfold increase. After the pandemic, there were no statistical differences between groups, although in terms of the means, psychologists in VA medical centers projected that they would use telepsychology the most in their practice.Demographics, Training, and Organizational PoliciesThe first multiple regression provided a statistically significant prediction of change in telepsychology use during the COVID-19 pandemic relative to before, F(6, 2612) = 34.94, p < .001, R2 = .074, a small-sized effect. When controlling for the other predictors, women increased their telepsychology use by 5.8% more than men or transgender/nonbinary individuals (p < .001). Psychologists practicing in rural locations increased their telepsychology use 4.1% less than psychologists practicing in urban or suburban locations (p = .046). Each whole increment increase in telepsychology training rating points resulted in an additional increase of 3.3% in telepsychology use (p < .001). Each whole increment increase in supportive telepsychology organizational policies rating points resulted in an additional increase of 1.6% in telepsychology use (p < .001). No other predictors exerted a unique effect (Table 3).TABLES AND FIGUREStable/figure thumbnailTable 3.

Significant Variables in Multiple Regression 2View larger image > in this page > in new window> Download slidePsychologists who treated antisocial personality disorder, who performed testing and evaluation, and who worked with rehabilitation populations had the lowest increases in percentage telepsychology use. Conversely, psychologists treating relationship issues, anxiety, and women’s issues had the highest increases in percentage telepsychology use.DiscussionThe current study is among the first to examine United States psychologists’ percentage of clinical work performed via telepsychology before, during, and projected after the COVID-19 pandemic, and to examine demographic, training, policy, and clinical practice predictors of these changes. This study is notable in that it drew data from a large national sample of 2,619 licensed psychologists currently practicing within the United States. Results supported hypotheses that use of telepsychology would significantly increase during the pandemic relative to prepandemic rates, and that psychologists would anticipate continuing to use telepsychology after the pandemic at higher rates than at baseline, though less than during the pandemic. Subsequent analyses also demonstrated the statistical effects of specific demographic, training, policy, and clinical practice characteristics on the change in use of telepsychology, suggesting that psychologists may be differentially able or willing to incorporate it into their own practice.These findings document an unprecedented shift in the uptake of telepsychology, as rates of utilization increased dramatically during the pandemic. Consistent with previous national research demonstrating low rates of telepsychology use with only about one fifth of practicing psychologists using telepsychology in their practice (Pierce et al., 2020b), psychologists in the current study estimated performing 7.07% of their clinical work with telepsychology before the pandemic. This is in stark comparison to psychologists’ estimates that telepsychology comprised 85.53% of their clinical work during the pandemic, an over 12-fold increase. Moreover, participants projected that 34.96% of their clinical work would be conducted via telepsychology even after the pandemic ceases, reflecting an important shift in attitudes toward the use of telepsychology. This represents a nearly fivefold increase from prepandemic rates, indicating the high likelihood of long-lasting changes in the use of telepsychology even after COVID-19-related concerns are ameliorated. These results serve to illustrate the telemedicine revolution (Perrin, Pierce, et al., 2020, p. 1) occurring with practice, policy, and attitudes toward telepsychology during the COVID-19 pandemic. Psychologists reported increasing the percentage of their clinical work via telepsychology at record rates, even within the VHA, where training and infrastructure have been in place for over a decade (Godleski et al., 2012).These results are also notable because they document the efforts of practicing psychologists to meet the increased mental health needs of the public. Research has already recorded increases in symptoms of anxiety and depression in the general population during the pandemic (Gao et al., 2020; Qiu et al., 2020), while simultaneously observing decreased access to traditional coping strategies (Harandi et al., 2017) and in-person options for health care (e.g., ACS, 2020; CDC, 2020b). Telepsychology presents an opportunity for psychologists to meet many patients’ mental health needs while supporting efforts to limit virus transmission.Overall, psychologists in group and individual practices reported the highest percentage use of telepsychology during the pandemic, though these percentages were only statistically different from psychologists in a hospital/medical practice, who reported the lowest percentage use. Psychologists in group practice reported the largest increase in telepsychology use during COVID-19 relative to baseline, with smaller increases in use observed in hospital/medical practice and VA medical centers. Within the VHA, lower change in percentage use was likely due in part to the higher-than-average rates of telepsychology use before COVID-19, and perhaps the level of bureaucracy involved in implementing additional changes relative to more nimble practice settings. These results suggest differential abilities of psychologists to introduce or increase telepsychology practice based on primary practice setting.Certainly, many commonly cited barriers to telepsychology were addressed on a national scale, such as privacy and security regulations (APA, 2014; OCR, 2020a, 2020b), Medicare reimbursement (Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, 2020), and training (e.g., APA, 2020), which likely impacted the universal increases in percentage of telepsychology use documented here. However, these findings also suggest that psychologists in group practice had access to the support needed to transition to telepsychology in conjunction with fewer procedural obstacles to overcome, and that working within a group practice provided opportunities for psychologists to address remaining environmental and individual barriers to uptake. For example, while psychologists have previously reported concerns about ease of telepsychology use (Pierce et al., 2020b), access to other practitioners within the group and/or administrative personnel may have increased the likelihood that typical concerns were readily addressed, particularly if a colleague was already using telepsychology. Further, new policies and guidance on telepsychology may have been more quickly and easily implemented within a group practice in comparison to a hospital system or VA medical center, where the more complex policy-making infrastructure may have slowed implementation.Results also supported previous research findings (Pierce et al., 2020a) that uptake of telepsychology during the pandemic would relate to several demographic variables. Woman-identified gender, nonrural practice setting, increased organizational policies supporting telepsychology, and increased training in telepsychology were all associated with increases in percentage of telepsychology use. Age and race/ethnicity were not associated with changes in telepsychology service provision. Despite the lack of age effects, the mean age and experience of the sample indicate that many participants probably trained in an era with less video conferencing technology; therefore many of these psychologists likely learned this approach and adapted rapidly during the demands of the COVID-19 pandemic.These findings have several important implications. First, the finding that psychologists who self-identified as women showed greater increases in percentage of telepsychology suggest that gender role variables may have affected these changes. For example, given that women tend to provide the majority of childcare (Bianchi, Sayer, Milkie, & Robinson, 2012), woman-identifying psychologists with children may have experienced a greater need to increase telepsychology use in order to facilitate provision of care at home after schools and childcare options were closed. Psychologists in rural locations may have experienced a lower demand for telepsychology, as initial rates of COVID-19 cases were generally higher in more populated states (CDC, 2020a). Previous research indicates rural psychologists have been less likely to use telepsychology within their practice (Pierce et al., 2020a). With that in mind, rural psychologists eager to offer their expertise to help areas more severely affected by the pandemic may experience the added benefit of filling openings within their schedules (Centore & Milacci, 2008). Rural psychologists or their patients may also have had limited access to technology required for telepsychology such as reliable high-speed Internet. The findings regarding training and policies underscore the importance of adequate organizational support in addressing both environmental and intrapsychic barriers to telepsychology use. This is reinforced by the finding that psychologists in VA medical centers reported higher percentage use before COVID-19 than psychologists in all other primary practice settings except individual practice, given VHA’s history of telepsychology infrastructure and accessibility of training (e.g., Caver et al., 2020).Finally, the current study explored therapeutic issues and diagnoses associated with increased telepsychology use during the pandemic in comparison to telepsychology use prior to the pandemic. These results suggested that some presenting concerns may be less amenable to clinical work via telepsychology, or that psychologists treating these issues experienced greater concerns about the use of telepsychology. It should be noted that while the overall regression model uncovered a medium-sized effect, the unique effects within the model were quite small and should be interpreted through that lens. The findings might suggest that psychologists believe that complex or severe symptomatology such as antisocial personality disorder, behavioral issues, and bipolar disorder may be more difficult to treat via telepsychology or may require specialized training for psychologists to feel comfortable adapting treatment to telepsychology; psychologists may also be reluctant to treat these issues via telepsychology because of perceived safety concerns. Traumatic brain injury and physical medicine and rehabilitation may be difficult to treat via telepsychology because of the need to coordinate care with in-person services like medical examinations and physical therapy. Testing and evaluation were also associated with lower increases in telepsychology uptake, which could indicate limited access to tests adapted for telepsychology use and concerns regarding test security. In contrast, anxiety, relationship difficulties, sleep/insomnia, and women’s issues were associated with greater increases in telepsychology uptake. To some extent, this finding may be impacted by increased rates of problems in these areas related to COVID-19 and therefore to increased demand for services. However, these results also suggest that these issues may be particularly amenable to treatment via telepsychology or that psychologists are more open to providing services for these concerns using telepsychology.Clinical and Training ImplicationsThe substantial changes in percentage of telepsychology use observed in the current study suggest that many of the previously documented barriers to telepsychology have been addressed, at least on a temporary basis, either by procedural changes or by the immediate needs of patients and providers during the COVID-19 pandemic. While some facilitating changes may be short-lived, these results also show that psychologists plan to continue using telepsychology at greater rates in the future relative to before the pandemic, suggesting important shifts in attitudes toward the use of telepsychology. Adequate training in telepsychology and supportive organizational policies and procedures appear to be an important component in increasing use, and are likely to continue to be a crucial factor in maintaining telepsychology use after risks of in-person health care associated with COVID-19 have lessened. A number of training resources exist, including trainings and tools published through the APA (e.g., APA, 2020), VHA, and others. In terms of training, it is surprising that psychologists within academic settings were not using telepsychology more often prior to the pandemic, and that they anticipated after the pandemic that they would be using it less than psychologists within individual practice, group practice, hospitals, and VA medical centers. Students enrolled in professional psychology training programs may benefit from access to information and training with telepsychology as an integral part of the curriculum.These findings also highlight factors associated with less substantial increases in telepsychology use that could serve as targets for future interventions to support telepsychology uptake. This study found that woman-identifying psychologists and those in nonrural primary practice settings were most likely to increase telepsychology use. Future research could explore in greater detail barriers to uptake in psychologists who identified as men, transgender, or nonbinary, as well as psychologists in rural practice settings, and additional training or supportive policy changes could be implemented to address these discrepancies if appropriate. Moreover, future interventions and research could be targeted at clinical issues associated with lower rates of uptake; for example, the findings regarding testing and evaluation suggest a need for valid computer adapted assessments that patients can complete from their homes without violating administration norms or test security practices.Limitations and Future DirectionsThe findings from the current study should be interpreted within the context of several limitations. The observational nature of the study precludes causal inferences about patterns in telepsychology use and uptake. Thus, although the study found demographic and practice-related predictors of increases in rate of telepsychology use, these variables are not necessarily causally related. Also, the recruitment method resulted in an 11.18% rate of completed response. Although this is typical for completion rates for emailed web survey invitations (Liu & Wronski, 2018; Petrovčič, Petrič, & Lozar Manfreda, 2016) and the sample demographics closely mirrored APA membership demographics (APA, 2018), there may be meaningful difference between those who opted to participate and those who did not. A large number of participants were excluded due to not providing informed consent, not completing the survey, or providing invalid answers to survey questions. Since the survey did not collect identifiable information (e.g., e-mail address, IP addresses) or use digital cookies to track and store progress, participants were required to complete the survey all at once, rather than saving progress to return later. Therefore, a substantial number of those not included (541 participants) may have abandoned the survey to attend to something else or experienced technical issues. Although no mention of telepsychology was made in the recruitment e-mail, it could be that those individuals who started but did not complete the survey differed in some way from other participants on views of telepsychology or psychotherapy practice. Also, there was small representation in the sample from psychologists practicing within correctional facilities, geriatric facilities, psychiatric hospitals, rehabilitation centers, and residential treatment centers. These settings typically have higher levels of in-person contact with the population they treat since their patients often reside on site. The study would have greatly benefited from the views of psychologists working within these environments.Since data for the current study were collected in May 2020 during the first wave of the pandemic, additional research is needed to determine whether the results will hold if the pandemic persists for longer than originally projected, or if additional waves of positive cases occur. For example, if the United States continues to experience high rates of positive cases in the absence of a widely available vaccine or effective treatments, it is possible that rates of telepsychology use may continue to increase, as patients may feel that they can no longer wait to access services.The survey questions did not ask participants to differentiate between their use of video-conferencing and telephone in the definition of telepsychology (“real-time audio (e.g., telephone) and/or video conferencing technology”), which was consistent with CMS definitions. Some psychologists may have communicated answers differently based on each delivery method, so future research should not only document rates of telepsychology use, but also nuances therein such as delivery methods and type of clinical work performed (e.g., psychotherapy vs. assessment). Although age was not revealed to be a significant predictor of change in telepsychology use during the pandemic, there may have been differences between younger and older participants in the type of telepsychology they use. These analyses also did not examine participants’ level of competency with telepsychology or ask about specific content within any training they have received. Future studies may consider exploring these topics.Also, this study was generally conducted from the vantage point that increased adoption of telepsychology is advantageous for the field and the public. As a result, variables were not included that could have shed extensive light on the limitations of telepsychology, such as barriers to adoption, negative feedback reported by patients, impact on clinical care, and so forth. Future research should attempt to assess for variables reflecting the limitations of telepsychology, rather than just its potential. Finally, the current study partly relied on psychologists’ recall of how often they were using telepsychology before the pandemic. Previous research has demonstrated that individuals’ recall of activities and experiences are affected by multiple recall biases (Solhan, Trull, Jahng, & Wood, 2009). Although psychologists were asked about overall telepsychology use just a few months prior, their answers concerning certain activities in their daily practice may have been distorted. Similarly, the current study assessed psychologists’ predictions in the percentage of their future clinical work that would be conducted via telepsychology, future policy impacts on telepsychology are not yet known. For example, it is unclear whether privacy/security regulations will be amended after the pandemic or will revert to prepandemic rules, and whether telepsychology services will continue to be reimbursed at rates comparable to in-person services. These policy changes may have substantial impacts on psychologists’ availability and attitudes toward offering telepsychology, even as self-efficacy and ease of use may increase over time. Additionally, ongoing research is necessary to evaluate the impact of these policy decisions on psychologists’ service delivery in order to ensure that the mental health needs of the general public are adequately met. Millions of people with a diagnosable mental disorder within the United States do not have adequate access to trained mental health professionals. Areas classified as rural contain an estimated 60 million people (U.S. Census Bureau, 2018), while most psychologists, social workers, and psychiatrists work within the wealthier neighborhoods of population-dense cities (Kazdin & Blase, 2011; U.S. Department of Health & Human Services, 2013). Furthermore, states with higher proportions of individuals with a mental illness also have a smaller proportion of psychologists to treat them (American Psychological Association [APA], 2014). This limits access to treatment for millions of people unable to attend in-person sessions with competent mental health professionals. The U.S. Health Resources & Services Administration (2020) reports that 112 million people are living within areas with a shortage of mental health providers and services.Telepsychology can be an important piece of the puzzle as psychologists attempt to reach people for whom time, distance, or situation are barriers to receiving traditional in-person psychotherapy. The APA (2015) defines telepsychology as providing psychological services through the use of technology. Although this can include the use of text, chat, e-mail, telephone, virtual reality, or even websites providing self-help information (Chester & Glass, 2006; Murphy & Mitchell, 1998), this article will focus solely on the delivery of psychotherapy through the use of videoconferencing technology.Numerous studies indicate telepsychology can be as effective as in-person interventions. Backhaus et al. (2012) conducted a meta-analysis of 65 research articles comparing interventions delivered via telepsychology with the same interventions delivered in person. Their results suggested that interventions using telepsychology were comparable to in-person psychotherapy in regards to patient satisfaction, symptom outcomes, and feasibility across a diverse sample (Backhaus et al., 2012). Equivalency in effectiveness was also observed by researchers conducting a meta-analysis of 24 randomized controlled noninferiority trials comparing telepsychology with in-person interventions for disorders such as depression, anxiety, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and adjustment disorder (Varker, Brand, Ward, Terhaag, & Phelps, 2019). It is important to note that a majority of the studies evaluating the efficacy of telepsychology utilize some form of behavior or exposure therapy and focus on treating symptoms of depression, anxiety, or PTSD. With that said, there are a variety of other treatments that have been successfully delivered via videoconferencing, suggesting that it can be broadly used to treat a range of patients (K. E. Anderson, Byrne, Crosby, & Le Grange, 2017) and with a range of approaches (Kobak, Lipsitz, Markowitz, & Bleiberg, 2017). The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has sustained a long commitment to telehealth and telepsychology to reach veterans across the country and has even developed their own telehealth platforms (VA, 2020).Although many psychologists may prefer to meet with their clients in person for every session, making this a requirement may reduce access to treatment. People with very limited time, restricted travel options, physical impairments, impaired cognition, or the inability to transfer caregiving responsibilities to others may have to forgo traditional in-person sessions (Savege Scharff & Martin, 2018). Considering the rich body of research suggesting a reciprocal relationship between mental and physical health (Cacioppo & Berntson, 2012; Dantzer, 2018; Herbert & Cohen, 1993), the traditional in-person requirement for mental health services places an unfair mental and physical toll on entire communities. A potential benefit that telepsychology may offer is the potential to mitigate these issues and enable psychologists to regularly meet with clients where they already are (Savege Scharff & Martin, 2018). Telepsychology can also increase access to psychologists with experience and training with a particular diagnosis, relevant cultural competency, or fluency in the client’s preferred language (Hailey, Roine, & Ohinmaa, 2008; Yellowlees, Marks, Hilty, & Shore, 2008). While states such as Texas, North Carolina, and Kansas have large, ethnically diverse populations living in rural areas, relying solely on in-person interventions could limit access to competent care (U.S. Census Bureau, 2016). Rather than depending on the particular competencies of practitioners within a reasonable driving distance, a person using telepsychology could potentially access any licensed psychologist within their state. Additionally, a federal rule in 2018 allowed VA-connected patients to access any VA health care providers, including psychologists, located across the country (VA, 2018). This allows VA-connected patients to receive care from providers in other states and even allows patients to receive care within their own home by using the VA Video Connect system. This change has the potential to expand the provision of highly specialized services to a greater percentage of veterans across the country regardless of their location and their ability to travel to a facility offering the health care services they need.The APA (2015) released a set of standards to guide psychologists engaging in telepsychology. Many of these are extensions of previous standards but have additional requirements for delivering psychological services using technology. For example, psychologists not only need competency using and gauging the appropriateness of interventions but also must develop competency with the technology used to deliver the interventions. These standards are vital as a guide for psychologists, but the added complexities they add are important to consider when evaluating telepsychology’s place within a practice. This may mean some psychologists are deterred by the need to gain a basic proficiency using computer networks, experience with specific telecommunications equipment such as digital cameras and microphones, and competency using the software connecting them with their clients during sessions (APA, 2015). Since access and proficiency with technology can greatly vary between clients, Wells et al. (2020) suggest scheduling a pretreatment session and building in additional time for appointments to handle technical issues and to determine alternate plans when available technology is insufficient. See Wells et al. (2020) for an excellent review of technical and practical issues to consider, as well as suggestions to address them. Furthermore, psychologists should also know if the populations they treat, and the methods they use, have been empirically demonstrated as appropriate and compatible with telepsychology. Additionally, psychologists may be concerned about shouldering additional risks to confidentiality associated with transmitting data over public networks and meaningfully informing their clients of these risks. Finally, a suitable plan must be in place in the event the network connection fails or when a client is in crisis, including knowledge of emergency services and important contacts within the client’s area (APA, 2015).Adding to the list of potential telepsychology deterrents, reimbursement for telepsychology sessions from public health care programs and health insurance providers can be difficult. For example, in 2016, Blue Cross Blue Shield only reimbursed for telepsychology visits if the psychologist was a member of an online provider’s network (Blue Cross Blue Shield, 2016). Until recently, Medicare would cover telehealth and telepsychology visits only if the client lived in a designated rural area and the session occurred within a health care facility. In 2019, the requirements were modified to allow telepsychology sessions when the client is at home if they are receiving treatment for substance abuse or a co-occurring mental health disorder. Additionally, starting in 2020, Medicare Advantage Plans may also cover telepsychology treatment no matter where the client is located (U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, 2020a). To increase access to vital care services, states such as Arizona and California have passed legislation requiring insurers cover telepsychology visits, although there are often differences in the specifics (California Insurance Code, 2011; Telemedicine Reimbursement Parity Act, 2016).The increased risk of unknowingly practicing across state lines (i.e., interjurisdictional practice) that comes with telepsychology can also be an issue. The client’s location during the session, and not that of the psychologist, determines which state’s laws are applicable (Kramer, Kinn, & Mishkind, 2015). If a client is traveling out of state but fails to inform the psychologist, the psychologist may be practicing without a license unless they meet the interjurisdictional requirements of the state where the client is located (Association of State and Provincial Psychology Boards, 2020). Even when the psychologist is notified that a patient is in a different state, the laws and requirements can vary greatly between states. Researching and complying with these differences between states could be particularly burdensome for psychologists treating patients who frequently travel to various states.Also, among the list of potential deterrents is that technological issues with the equipment and network infrastructure used for telepsychology can interfere with interactions during sessions. Network latency (i.e., lag) creating delays of 500 ms or more can negatively impact the conversation (Tam, Carter, Kiesler, & Hodgins, 2012), as both individuals are more likely to inadvertently talk over one another or experience longer than usual pauses during the conversation (Kurita, Lai, & Kitawaki, 1994). Also, if one party’s microphone is picking up the audio signal from speakers, the other party can have significant trouble speaking while hearing their own voice played back to them with a significant delay (i.e., delayed auditory feedback; Yates, 1963). Furthermore, camera placement can impact the interpersonal experience. It is common to position cameras above the video screen, but this causes each participant to see the other participant looking down rather than making eye contact. To address this, a number of gaze correction solutions have been developed, but they can be expensive and introduce distracting or even disturbing video artifacts such as flickering seams around the face as elements of the head image are shifted (Chen, 2002; Khan, Li, & ur Réhman, 2016; Kuster, Popa, Bazin, Gotsman, & Gross, 2012). This may be especially problematic when utilizing psychodynamic approaches relying on the therapist’s ability to carefully create a setting and situation in which the patient can openly express themselves (Essig & Russell, 2017; Savege Scharff & Tao, 2018).Previous research has examined the concerns and training needs of psychologists and doctoral psychology students. Within a sample obtained by Perle, Burt, and Higgins (2014), 74.1% of psychologists indicated they were not likely to refer anyone for telepsychology. Participants indicated that they were most concerned about information regarding ethics, legal issues, evidence of effectiveness, strategies for crisis management, reimbursement, costs, and setup. Further research also revealed mental health providers’ adoption of evidence-based practice is influenced by practice setting and organizational culture (Aarons, 2004), age, race/ethnicity, and gender (Aarons et al., 2010).In early 2020, authorities within the Chinese health system notified the World Health Organization (WHO) that they had detected a new virus strain, termed “COVID-19,” among their population (WHO, 2020a). On January 20, 2020, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed that a patient in Seattle, Washington, who had recently visited China had tested positive for COVID-19 (Holshue et al., 2020). Within a few weeks, more than 118,00 individuals testing positive for COVID-19 had been detected worldwide, leading WHO to declare the virus a global pandemic (WHO, 2020b). In response to anticipated health care needs and to facilitate social distancing to slow transmission rates, multiple agencies within the United States adjusted key policies to promote the use of telehealth and telepsychology to meet demand for services. The Office for Civil Rights within the Department of Health and Human Services suspended the Privacy Rule within the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act that had previously prevented the use of several commonly used teleconferencing platforms such as Skype and FaceTime (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2020a, 2020b). Medicare and Medicaid temporarily adjusted their policy to reimburse all telehealth and telepsychology visits at the same rate as in-person visits, as well as allowing telepsychology visits within patients’ homes (U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, 2020b). Health care providers such as Johns Hopkins (Nitkin, 2020), Mayo Clinic (Stiepan, 2020), and the VA (2020) announced policy changes to promote and meet the unprecedented need for telehealth and telepsychology services.Psychologists exploring the possibility of telepsychology within their practice have quite a bit to consider. Among these concerns are efficacy, legal issues, organizational policies, additional training, client safety, reimbursement, telepsychology’s potential impact on the therapeutic relationship, and the financial costs that come with it (Perle et al., 2014). Examining these complex and interrelated issues may help explain why, before the COVID-19 pandemic, an estimated 80% of psychologists had never used telepsychology. Building on previous research examining the concerns and training needs of psychologists (Perle et al., 2014), the purpose of this study is to collect and categorize a comprehensive list of telepsychology deterrents identified by psychologists not currently using it before the COVID-19 pandemic and then identify significant practice and demographic predictors of psychologists’ reported concerns about telepsychology. The current study is a secondary data analysis using data from a previous study examining theoretical models predicting psychologists’ use of telepsychology (Pierce, Perrin, & McDonald, 2020).MethodParticipantsEligibility requirements for participants were that they (a) were 18 years or older, (b) were licensed to practice psychology in at least one state within the United States, (c) were currently practicing psychology, (d) had earned a doctoral degree, and (e) were not currently using telepsychology within their practice. A recruitment list was compiled using online rosters of professional organizations (e.g., APA), psychology newsgroups (e.g., Society for Military Psychology, Society for Counseling Psychology), and publicly available information provided on mental health provider websites. The list included 28,276 names and e-mail addresses of individuals who were potentially practicing within the United States as a psychologist. Data were collected between July 6, 2017, through July 26, 2017. E-mailed invitations to the list resulted in undeliverable notifications from 16.1% of the list, while delivered invitations led to 2,138 (9.0%) of individuals completing the survey. This rate of response aligns with previous research examining response rates and completion rates for e-mailed web surveys (Liu & Wronski, 2018; Petrovčič, Petrič, & Lozar Manfreda, 2016). This study was reviewed by the Virginia Commonwealth University Independent Review Board to ensure it was conducted ethically and in compliance with all federal, state, and local regulations concerning research involving human participants. Survey answers were reviewed to find meaningless answers to free response items, unlikely responses, and impossible answers. Two responses were discarded because the entered years in practice and stated age suggested the respondent started practicing at or before age 2. Another 347 survey responses were discarded based on blank or meaningless answers to a final free-response validity check question. This question was used to detect participants who were providing quick and nonsensical answers to reach the end. One record was discarded since the respondent indicated they were only licensed to practice outside of the United States. Finally, 389 respondents indicated they were currently using telepsychology within their practice. This resulted in a sample of 1,400 participants (see Table 1)TABLES AND FIGUREStable/figure thumbnailTable 1. Summary of Participant CharacteristicsView larger image > in this page > in new window> Download slidewith representation from each state and Washington, DC.ProcedureInvitations to participate were e-mailed directly to a list of potential participants. The invitation explained why they were invited to participate, a brief description of the study’s purpose, the criteria for participant inclusion, and an HTML link. Recruits who clicked on the HTML link were taken to a page with more details about the study, institutional review board information, methods for contacting the authors, and an informed consent form. Once the recruits consented to the study, they were taken to an online survey designed using the Qualtrics (2017) platform. The first four questions asked participants to verify that they were over 18 years of age, have a doctorate in psychology, are licensed to practice psychology somewhere within the United States, and are currently practicing as psychologists. Before continuing, they were presented with the following statement, “For the purpose of this survey, ‘telepsychology’ refers the use of video conferencing technology to provide psychotherapy.” The remainder of the survey asked them to provide demographic data about themselves, information about their practice, and details about their concerns, attitudes, and perceptions concerning telepsychology. As a final check for validity, participants were asked to provide a response the question, “In one sentence or less, what do you think the purpose of this study was?”MeasuresDemographicsSurvey items recorded participant responses concerning their age, years in practice as a psychologist, the number of psychologists in their place of practice, their theoretical approach to psychotherapy, if they currently use telepsychology, the primary focus on their practice (e.g., eating disorders, addiction, depression, family conflict, racial identity), the states they are licensed to practice within, and the density of the community (urban, suburban, or rural setting). Race/ethnicity was indicated by selecting from a predefined a list of forced choices comprising White/European American (non-Latino/non-Hispanic), Black/African American (non-Latino/non-Hispanic), Latino/Hispanic, Asian/Asian American (non-Latino/non-Hispanic), American Indian/Alaska Native/Native American, multiracial/multiethnic, and “other.” The item capturing theoretical approach responses offered a list of forced choices, including Acceptance and Commitment, Cognitive Behavioral, Existential, Family Systems, Feminist, Gestalt, Individual/Adlerian, Interpersonal, Jungian, Narrative, Person-Centered/Rogerian, Psychoanalysis, Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy, Reality Therapy, Solution-Focused Therapy, and “other.” Participants who selected “other” were provided a text box and asked, “please specify.”DeterrentsParticipants were asked, “If you DO NOT currently use telepsychology, what led to this decision (select all that apply)? (State laws prohibit its use, Organizational policies prohibit its use, Client Safety/Crisis concerns, Cost, Efficacy, Ethics, Privacy, Legality, Reimbursement, Insufficient training, Other [Please specify]).” Participants were allowed to select multiple items.ResultsDescriptive AnalysisTo summarize psychologists’ deterrents to using telepsychology, percentages of psychologists in the sample who endorsed the researcher-provided options were calculated. In order to analyze the responses to the “Other [Please specify]” item, an eight-step qualitative analysis process described by Zhang and Wildemuth (2009) was conducted. The initial set of codes and descriptions were the researcher-provided options listed above. Two raters familiar with the telepsychology literature reviewed the 402 responses to the survey’s “Other [Please specify]” item. The two raters independently sample-coded a random selection of items, frequently consulting the list of codes for guidance. Each rater’s sample or responses was compared with one another and resulted in an interrater reliability of 79.2%. The raters discussed areas for improvement. The descriptors were modified for greater clarity, and three pairs of codes were combined, resulting in the final list of 16 codes (see Table 2).TABLES AND FIGUREStable/figure thumbnailTable 2. Final List of DeterrentsView larger image > in this page > in new window> Download slideThe two raters coded a new random sample of responses and compared results, achieving an acceptable interrater reliability score of 86.6%. The remaining items were coded by each rater while they frequently reviewed the list of codes to maintain consistency. Upon completion, the results were compared. A third person reviewed the responses for which there was disagreement and served as a tiebreaker while also frequently consulting the list of codes and descriptions. These data were combined and analyzed with data obtained from the list of researcher-provided options (see Table 3).TABLES AND FIGUREStable/figure thumbnailTable 3. Percentage Endorsed of Each Telepsychology DeterrentView larger image > in this page > in new window> Download slideLogistic RegressionsA series of binary logistic regressions were used to model the most frequently endorsed (20% or more) binary variables of deterrents (with not endorsing the deterrent as the reference category; Table 4).TABLES AND FIGUREStable/figure thumbnailTable 4. Variables in Logistic RegressionsView larger image > in this page > in new window> Download slidePredictor variables included participant age, as well as binary predictor variables of masculine gender (man), White/European American race/ethnicity, practicing within a rural community, practicing within a VA or medical center, and using cognitive–behavioral therapy (CBT) as a treatment approach to therapy.TrainingThe first logistic regression model did not provide a statistically significant prediction of psychologists endorsing insufficient training as a concern, χ2(6) = 9.132, p = .166.SafetyThe second model provided a statistically significant prediction of endorsing safety as a concern, χ2(6) = 27.193, p < .000. The Nagelkerke pseudo-R2 indicated the model accounted for approximately 2.8% of the total variance. When controlling for the other predictors, the likelihood of endorsing safety as a concern for psychologists who did not use telepsychology was lower for cisgender men, White psychologists, practitioners within a VA or medical center, and those using a CBT approach. No other predictors exerted a unique effect on endorsing safety as a concern.PrivacyThe third model provided a statistically significant prediction of endorsing privacy as a concern, χ2(6) = 33.722, p < .001, Nagelkerke pseudo-R2 = .035. The likelihood of endorsing privacy as a concern was lower for cisgender men, those practicing within a rural community, and those practicing within a VA or medical center.Legal issuesThe fourth model provided a statistically significant prediction of endorsing legal issues as a concern, χ2(6) = 19.546, p = .003, Nagelkerke pseudo-R2 = .021. The likelihood of endorsing legal issues as a concern was lower for older psychologists, those practicing within a rural community, and those who practiced within a VA or medical center.EthicsThe fifth model provided a statistically significant prediction of endorsing ethical issues as a concern, χ2(6) = 22.284, p = .001, Nagelkerke pseudo-R2 = .023. The likelihood of endorsing ethics as a concern was lower for those practicing within a VA or medical center.ReimbursementThe sixth model provided a statistically significant prediction of endorsing reimbursement as a concern, χ2(6) = 15.123, p = .019, Nagelkerke pseudo-R2 = .016. The likelihood of endorsing reimbursement as a concern was lower for older psychologists.EfficacyThe seventh model provided a statistically significant prediction of endorsing efficacy as a concern, χ2(6) = 49.573, p < .001, Nagelkerke pseudo-R2 = .054. The likelihood of endorsing efficacy as a concern was higher for older psychologists but lower for those practicing within a VA or medical center and those using a CBT approach.DiscussionThe purpose of this study was to collect and categorize the concerns psychologists have regarding telepsychology and to examine demographic and practice characteristics that predict psychologists’ endorsement of those concerns. This is important for mental health since telepsychology has the potential for reaching people in need of mental health services but who are limited by time, distance, or circumstances from attending in-person sessions. While many hospitals and health care institutions within the United States have adopted telehealth of some kind (U.S. Department of Health & Human Services, 2016), prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, an overwhelming majority of practicing psychologists did not offer telepsychology as an option for their clients (Perle et al., 2014; Pierce, Perrin, & McDonald, 2020). This study helps clarify the most important deterrents psychologists face when considering telepsychology within their own practice.The results indicate that psychologists not using telepsychology primarily chose not to do so because they believed the effectiveness of treatment would be diminished and that they had concerns about exposing their clients to increased risks. These concerns included receiving insufficient training to be effective with telepsychology, ensuring the client’s safety or addressing the needs of remote clients in crisis, protecting the privacy of clients, considering ethical issues that could result from using telepsychology, and being uncertain about the effectiveness of treatment when not conducted in person. Among less frequently endorsed concerns were understanding and addressing legal complexities, reimbursement concerns, organizational barriers, a perceived lack of demand, and the additional financial costs or time commitment that could result from telepsychology adoption. The large proportion of individuals citing concerns about legal and reimbursement issues suggests that advocacy efforts to examine and adjust these systemic issues could result in more frequent use of telepsychology when it is appropriate. In this light, it is not surprising these barriers were recognized and addressed by swift federal changes to policy in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.The results suggest that psychologists practicing within medical centers or VA facilities were less likely to endorse safety, privacy, legal issues, ethics, and efficacy as concerns when compared to psychologists in other settings. The adoption rate of telehealth (the use of technology to deliver health care services) within hospitals has been increasing over the past several years (Huilgol, Miron-Shatz, Joshi, & Hollander, 2020). The VA reports more than 2 million telehealth visits occurred during the fiscal year of 2016 (VA, 2017). As psychologists see their colleagues use this option to treat clients, it is reasonable that they would have diminished concerns about its efficacy. Also, VA and medical centers often have carefully crafted, well-communicated policies and guidelines to protect patient privacy and safety. For example, the VA requires practitioners to complete several courses explaining how to use their telehealth platforms, as well as information about legal issues, VA policies, and best practices concerning telehealth visits (Caver et al., 2019). It is understandable that psychologists within these settings would feel more confident that they can address these issues and find answers if necessary. Furthermore, psychologists within a VA setting are operating within a large health care system with its associated resources (e.g., veterans’ crisis line, medical center emergency departments at VA medical centers, suicide prevention coordinators, standardized safety plans, high-risk intervention teams) to address urgent needs as they arise. Finally, federal laws allowing VA psychologists to provide treatment to VA patients regardless of their location within the United States would dampen concerns about legal issues.Also, older psychologists were less concerned about reimbursement issues and more concerned about the effectiveness of using telepsychology. Predictably, age and years in practice were highly correlated within this sample. It may be that older, more experienced practitioners better understand how to work with insurance providers to ensure they get paid for their services. On the other hand, when compared to younger groups, older individuals have been shown to be less comfortable being open and vulnerable when using online social platforms (Gibson et al., 2010) and are more likely to perceive online relationships as shallow (Jung, Walden, Johnson, & Sundar, 2017; Lehtinen, Näsänen, & Sarvas, 2009). Psychologists possessing these beliefs and attitudes who choose not to use telepsychology may be making a decision based in part on the perceived importance of in-person connections to facilitate interpersonal interactions, therapeutic alliance, and vulnerability. It may be that these fundamental assumptions regarding what needs to happen within the therapy relationship (e.g., alliance), as well as assumptions concerning the ability to achieve these requirements while using telepsychology, may be at the core of the issue for these psychologists. Further studies examining if these assumptions regarding the ideal nature of the therapy relationship can be met using telepsychology, and disseminating the results to practitioners, could have an impact on future use. Also, future studies on receptivity toward telepsychology may consider examining broader attitudes toward social media and online relationships.Those who engaged in CBT were also less likely to report efficacy and safety as deterrents to adopting telepsychology than psychologists using other approaches to psychotherapy. The lower concerns about efficacy and safety, two sides of the same coin, may be partially accounted for by noting the high number of studies using CBT to examine telepsychology’s effectiveness. A meta-analysis conducted by Varker et al. (2019) reviewing studies of telepsychology’s effectiveness revealed that CBT was the most common approach utilized. As Johnsen and Friborg (2015) suggest, this may be the result of how highly standardized CBT has remained for decades, lending itself well to studies comparing outcomes between groups. On the other hand, it may be that, for some unexamined reason, CBT is simply better suited for telepsychology than other theoretical approaches to psychotherapy. The results may suggest that telepsychology efficacy literature would benefit from future noninferiority studies utilizing a more diverse representation of theoretical approaches.Finally, among psychologists not using telepsychology, being White was not seen as a consistent predictor of most of the issues raised. Although Whites were statistically less likely to endorse safety as a concern, this result may be spurious considering the fluctuating direction of results across the list of concerns analyzed. Future research may attempt to validate, and if replicated, attempt to understand this result.Limitations and Future DirectionsAlthough this study provides some insights concerning psychologists’ concerns about telepsychology, it has some limitations to consider. To begin with, the data were gathered before the COVID-19 pandemic. There have been major changes to the environment within which psychologists evaluate telepsychology. The need for social distancing, as well as the adjustment of multiple laws and policies, has led to unprecedented levels of telepsychology and telehealth usage (Pierce, Perrin, Tyler, McKee, & Watson, 2020). As psychologists gain training and experience with telepsychology, it may have a significant impact on their attitudes concerning its effectiveness and appropriateness with the populations they treat. The experience gained during this period can guide organizations and training programs as they develop education for psychologists that takes into account the populations they treat, the setting they practice within, approach, and so on. For example, Wells et al. (2020) provide an excellent overview of lessons learned delivering prolonged exposure therapy using telepsychology during the pandemic. A future follow-up study could survey psychologists to see which, if any, of these barriers or concerns persist and to what degree.Another limitation is that the sample was skewed on certain factors such as race/ethnicity. There was an overrepresentation of White participants (90.3%) and participants practicing in individual or group practice (65.6%) when compared with the percentage of APA members who are White (84%; Lin, Stamm, & Christidis, 2018) or work in independent practice (K. Stamm, Lin, & Christidis, 2017). The use of Internet-based surveys can be problematic in that they may unintentionally result in a skewed sample of the population. Although steps were taken to ensure participants were engaged throughout the entirety of the survey, and a large sample was obtained, research utilizing Internet surveys faces difficulties when attempting to control who ultimately decides to participate (T. Anderson & Kanuka, 2002; Leary, 2012). Although the sample was sufficient for achieving significance in one category concerning race/ethnicity and treatment setting, the sample lacked sufficient diversity for a more nuanced analysis. The interaction of race/ethnicity and attitudes toward telepsychology are likely to be very complex and may be impacted by individual-, community-, and systems-level factors that are worth exploring but not able to be handled effectively with this study’s data. Further exploration of factors such as the perspectives on telepsychology’s impact on social justice, disparities in resources impacting access, or access to psychologists with greater cultural competence in areas where that may not be available deserve further exploration.Next, some deterrent categories may be underrepresented. There were four categories added during the qualitative analysis based on typed responses to the “other” category. Although 28.6% of participants did take time to enter items not listed, it is likely these categories would have been endorsed more often had they also been included as an easy to select checklist item. The final list is likely to contain the majority of concerns psychologists have when considering telepsychology and might serve as a guide for future exploration.An additional limitation is the lack of data from psychologists who do use telepsychology within their practice. Without those data, it is not clear what deterrents vary across the different groups. For example, both groups may have concerns about safety or reimbursements but may vary on prohibitive organizational policies within the institution in which they practice. Future studies could ask about barriers and deterrents for both those who do use telepsychology and those who do not.A final limitation of this study is that the total variance explained by the logistic regression models ranged between 1.6% and 5.4%. Although most of the models achieved statistical significance, the revealed differences between groups were small. As a result, the interpretation of these results should be tempered.ConclusionThe study revealed several important deterrents reported by psychologists who are not currently using telepsychology. Insufficient training was endorsed as the most common deterrent to using telepsychology. Providing more information and training resources could potentially encourage more psychologists to consider its use and provide more mental health care access to populations that traditional in-person approaches do not currently reach. In particular, more academic institutions might consider adding training in telepsychology to their programs as they prepare psychologists to meet the public’s mental health needs. Not doing so may unknowingly communicate negative messages concerning its use. The results also suggest that, among psychologists who do not use telepsychology, their concerns slightly vary depending on demographic and practice characteristics. Organizations interested in promoting or implementing telepsychology might benefit from tailoring programs to address specific needs of the psychologists they work with rather than adopting a “one-size-fits-all” solution. There is a worldwide gap between the mental health needs of children and adolescents and them receiving treatment (Kieling, Baker-Henningham, Belfer, et al., 2011; Patel, Kieling, Maulik, & Divan, 2013), one that has been exacerbated by the COVID-19 crisis (Duan & Zhu, 2020; Lee, 2020). Under normal circumstances, fewer than a quarter of children with mental health disorders are appropriately identified as needing services (Jensen, Goldman, Offord, et al., 2011). This includes at least 15% of U.S. students struggling with learning and attention problems and needs that go unidentified, unaddressed, and unmet (Cortiella & Horowitz, 2014). The COVID-19 crisis has largely curtailed the evaluation of mental health and educational needs (Pfefferbaum & North, 2020), meaning even more learning difficulties will go unidentified.There are many barriers to children receiving assessment and treatment for mental health and learning needs, one of which relates to limited access to appropriate services. Access to services is also rife with structural inequities (Kastrup, 2019; Saxena, Thornicroft, Knapp, & Whiteford, 2007), and disasters tend to both highlight and exacerbate such inequities (Yun, Lurie, & Hyde, 2010). School psychologists are generally less available in rural areas, as well as overwhelmed in suburban and urban areas (Clopton & Knesting, 2006; Myers et al., 2010). Especially vulnerable to not receiving adequate psychoeducational services are children of color (Morgan, Farkas, Hillemeier, & Maczuga, 2012; Morgan et al., 2015), in part because of less general access (Flores, 2010; Inkelas, Raghavan, Larson, Kuo, & Ortega, 2007). Not just limited to academic and mental health evaluations, during the COVID-19 crisis, those from the most vulnerable populations have the least access to services they need (van Dorn, Cooney, & Sabin, 2020).Between an identified shortage of school psychologists in rural areas (Castillo, Curtis, & Tan, 2014; Fagan, 2004; Gadke, Valley-Gray, & Rossen, 2016) and many school psychologists, who spend the overwhelming majority of their time doing psychoeducational testing and related services (Curtis, Chesno-Grier, Abshier, Sutton, & Hunley, 2002; Reschly, 2000) working at over twice the capacity recommended by the National Association of School Psychologists (2010), a redistribution of resources is necessary. Prior to COVID-19, there was a call for assessment services provided in schools to be comprehensive, widely available, and even more utilized, despite the challenges of access (Cummings et al., 2004). In the era of COVID-19, there has been a specific call for students with learning challenges and other disabilities not go unevaluated and thus unsupported, despite even greater structural challenges (Wright, 2020).While not without challenges and necessary adaptations (Alami, Gagnon, & Fortin, 2019), telehealth has the potential to significantly redistribute (especially geographically, but also socioeconomically) mental health and psychological testing resources (Grady, 2012). Online mental health services, and specifically Internet-based testing, have been championed because of the potential for improved access by overcoming many practical constraints (Barak, 1999; Berends et al., 2004; Young, 2005). Internet-based and videoconferencing assessment services have been used globally with children and youth (Boydell et al., 2014; Lingely-Pottie & McGrath, 2006; Reed, McLaughlin, & Milholland, 2000), largely to fill in gaps in access in areas with greater demand than local service providers are able to meet (Boydell et al., 2014; Cruz, Krupinski, Lopez, & Weinstein, 2005; Elford et al., 2000; Myers, Valentine, & Melzer, 2007, 2008; Pesämaa et al., 2004, 2007). However, a disproportionate burden has been placed on performance-based cognitive (and other) assessment, especially during this COVID-19 crisis moment, when providers are being forced to adapt much more rapidly than research agendas will allow. Cognitive and other performance-based measures are harder to adapt to a remote, online format than, for example, counseling services, and with student need continuing without pause, there is no time to wait for robust bodies of research to renorm tests in this new format.Remote, online administration of cognitive measures has the potential to increase access to these services by redistributing the workforce. During the COVID-19 crisis, in many places in the United States, it will be the only option, if services are to continue. Even though some general guidance has been provided for how to adapt tests generally to a remote, online format (Wright, Mihura, Pade, & McCord, 2020) during the COVID-19 crisis, this is not a replacement for systematic research on the equivalence of testing in this format to a traditional, in-person administration.Given the range of psychological processes engaged during the course of a typical cognitive (intelligence) evaluation (Kovacs & Conway, 2019), altering the format of administration could in theory alter the tasks, and thus the emerging data, significantly. Some of these alterations and their likely effects are more obvious, such as stimuli being shown in different formats (on an upright screen, as opposed to a flat stimulus book or tablet). Some may be more subtle, though, such as a change in the interpersonal interaction between examiner and student in this format, interaction with a proctor on the student’s side, or potentially students being able to see themselves in the telehealth platform. Each of these has the potential to affect students’ performance on tasks. However, efforts need to be made to try to approximate standardized, in-person administration as closely as possible. Adaptations can include some modifications to administration prompts, where and how stimulus materials are presented on the screen, and how to coach and use a proctor at specific moments in administration. To evaluate the effectiveness of these alterations, they should be consistent and standardized, just as examiners are taught to adhere to standardized administration procedures in traditional testing.Two issues become especially salient in the delivery of remote, online performance-based assessments. First, it becomes much more difficult to maintain test security and integrity, mandated in the psychology ethics code (American Psychological Association, 2017). While psychologists never have full control over test security, it is important that they take reasonable steps to protect it (Wright et al., 2020), including explicitly telling clients and proctors that screen recording and screenshots are not allowed. Having a proctor present (as was the case in the present study) significantly reduces the ability for clients to compromise the security and integrity of tests.Second, the requirement for clients to have reliable, high-speed Internet access and appropriate technology can amplify structural inequities in our society (Wright et al., 2020), with the most vulnerable and high-need populations having the least access to assessment (and other) services (Yun et al., 2010; van Dorn et al., 2020). Although it may be beyond assessment psychologists to solve these larger societal inequities themselves, having the option to conduct even remote, online assessments in a neutral, equipped place, such as a school (again, as was the case in the present study), can mitigate the barriers that vulnerable populations may face in accessing tele-assessment services.The Wechsler Intelligence Scales for Children, in their continually updated forms (currently the fifth edition; WISC-V; Wechsler, 2014a), are internationally the most widely used test with children and adolescents (Oakland, Douglas, & Kane, 2016). It often serves as the basis for learning disability evaluations (Oakland et al., 2016), attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder evaluations (Moura, Costa, & Simões, 2019), and other issues, such as intellectual developmental disorder, giftedness, and autism spectrum disorder (Miller et al., 2019). It already has a history of some adaptation for new technology, as it was adapted and tested for equivalency using the Q-Interactive system, utilizing iPads to display administration information and record forms for the examiner and stimulus materials and response forms for students (Daniel, Wahlstrom, & Zhang, 2014). Adapting the WISC-V for use in a remote, online administration environment has the potential for increasing access to this widely used test in significant ways, especially during the COVID-19 crisis.Present StudyThe present study aimed to evaluate the equivalence of two administration procedures of the WISC-V: the traditional, standardized, in-person administration and remote, digital, online administration (entirely remote, using a telehealth platform). The equivalence of data captured by remote, online administration and traditional, in-person administration was evaluated. The goal was to evaluate both index and subtest standard scores, to determine if there was a significant impact of the method of administration, to determine if the current normative and psychometric information from the traditional, in-person test development could be applied to the remote, online format. It must be noted that this study evaluated a very specific set of protocols for delivering remote, online administration of the WISC-V. The generalizability of any findings should be limited to trained test administrators who follow the specific protocol examined, as closely as possible, including specific digital platform requirements, examiner training, and use of an informed in-person proctor.MethodEquivalence Study DesignFor the present study, a case control match design was utilized, in which examinees took the WISC-V in only one format (traditional, in-person or remote, online). While a matched design required a larger sample, it avoided testing effects of test-retest or alternate forms designs. That is, when an examinee answers either the same type of problem or the exact problem more than once, learning may have occurred (of the problem-solving strategy or the content) that can alter the performance the second time. The case control match design created two groups that were matched on specific variables/characteristics (in this case age and gender), each group receiving only one format of test administration, as would be the case in clinical practice. Therefore, two groups roughly equal in number, matched on age and gender, were created, with examinees randomly assigned to one of the two groups. The Kaufman Brief Intelligence Test, Second Edition (KBIT-2) was also administered in the same administration format (traditional, standardized, in-person) to all participants to be able to pair participants on IQ to better ensure equivalent groups.ParticipantsThe sample consisted of 256 children, ages 6 to 16, who were recruited by between December 2019 and April 2020 in varied regions across the country (12% from the Midwest, 18% from the Northeast, 40% from the South, 15% from the Southeast, and 15% from the West). Participants were recruited from schools with demographic characteristics similar to a general school population and were not specifically screened for any specific disorders (intellectual, learning, or otherwise), to maintain generalizability to the general population. However, there were no participants with specific hearing, vision, or physical impairments in the present study. Case control matching (on age and gender) was used for the study. Participants were randomly assigned to either remote, online administration or traditional, in-person administration of the WISC-V, with roughly equal numbers in each cell by age and gender (see Table 1).TABLES AND FIGUREStable/figure thumbnailTable 1. Demographic Characteristics of the SampleView larger image > in this page > in new window> Download slideIt should be noted that because of the COVID-19 crisis, data collection was stopped before the full intended sample could be evaluated; as such, the cells were not entirely equal in the case control matched design.Table 1 reports demographic characteristics of the sample. The subgroups taking the WISC-V with standard or remote administration were very similar. Overall, there was roughly equal representation of males and females, across administration formats.MeasuresKaufman Brief Intelligence Test, Second Edition (KBIT-2)The KBIT-2 (Kaufman, 2004) is a brief, individually administered broad intelligence measure consisting of three subtests. Two subtests, Verbal Knowledge and Riddles, compose a Verbal scale, and one subtest, Matrices, composes a Nonverbal scale. Together, the three subtests contribute to a general IQ composite score. The test and its scales have exhibited good internal consistency and appear to measure what they purport to measure (Bain & Jaspers, 2010), with particular strength of the IQ composite.Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, Fifth Edition (WISC-V)The WISC-V (Wechsler, 2014a) is an individually administered, multisubtest, performance-based intellectual ability test for children aged 6–16. The widely used measure produces an overall full-scale IQ, as well as multiple index scores for component domains of intellectual functioning. The test has exhibited strong reliability of its scores and validity of its score interpretations in its traditional, standardized format (Dombrowski, Canivez, & Watkins, 2018; Na & Burns, 2016; Wechsler, 2014b), especially noted for its strong validity evidence base as a measure of general intelligence.ProcedureAll procedures of the present study were approved by PresenceLearning’s research review committee, which oversees human protections and research ethics. Examiners were school and clinical psychologists qualified and experienced in administering the WISC-V and KBIT-2, as well as the use of the telehealth platform that was specifically configured for the administration of psychological tests. As each participant was scheduled for testing, they were randomly assigned to either the traditional, in-person or the remote, online administration format, with the requirement that the cases within each Age × Gender “cell” would be divided generally equally between the formats.For the present study, all stimulus materials for the WISC-V were provided by Pearson in PDF format for the ability to present it via screen presentation (they have made these materials temporarily available more widely during the COVID-19 crisis via qglobal.pearsonclinical.com). Therefore, no physical stimulus book was needed for the remote, online administration procedure, nor was a document camera to project stimulus materials from physical stimulus books from the examiner’s side to the examinee. Examinees needed to have at least a 13-in. monitor to maintain size commensurate with the printed stimulus books, and this was verified ahead of time.Each examinee first took the KBIT-2. Every examinee was administered the KBIT-2 in the same format: traditional, paper-and-pencil format. Then each examinee took the complete WISC-V, in standard test sequence, in the assigned format (remote, online or traditional, in-person). For the purposes of this study, remote, online administration was simulated, using different rooms within the same setting (most often two different rooms within the participant’s home, the examiner’s home, or in a school office setting). The same examiner administered the WISC-V as had administered the KBIT-2, with a 15-min break between them (regardless of format), to standardize fatigue effects across the two groups. Typically, both the examiner and participant were connected to the same Internet connection, which may have reduced some potential technological hitches that can arise from unreliable Internet connectivity on either or both ends of the tele-assessment dyad.Examiners’ scoring decisions were used in the present analysis for any test that required immediate scoring (to determine reaching basals and ceilings/discontinues, for example), to determine whether examiners’ decisions were affected by format. That is, any test that needed immediate scoring utilized immediate scoring, and each was checked afterward for accuracy by a member of the research team, to determine if the administration format affected how accurate these scoring decisions were. All subtests that did not require immediate scoring were scored after the fact by the research team, and all raw scores were entered into the WISC-V online scoring program via Q-Global, regardless of administration format, in the same manner. Data were reviewed for quality by examining any potential outliers and data entry mistakes (e.g., scores that fell outside of the possible range), and entry errors were corrected.Proctors (in-person assistants used in the remote, online administration procedure) were recruited from different sources. Of note, they were not psychological professionals and at no time performed any task that required prior training or a clinical background. They did no demonstration of any items or any other actual assessment function. The proctors received a <10-min preparatory lesson about what to expect and how and how not to interact with the examinee and examiner and received a written guide about how to facilitate the setting up of the cameras on the examinee’s side. Specifically, the proctors were used to verify that the video and sound were working properly on the participants’ end of the assessment before the evaluation started, handing the participants physical items (like blocks and response booklets) for younger participants, and providing overall safety supervision (having an adult in the room in case of an emergency). Specifically for block design, for younger examinees, the proctor picked up and dropped the blocks between items; older examinees were instructed to do so, and in both cases the examiner prompted if and when the scrambled blocks needed to be adjusted. When the proctor was not completing one of these tasks at the direction of the examiner, they were asked to sit in the back of the room, out of the examinee’s line of vision, and within eyesight of the examiner on the videoconferencing platform, so that the examiner could verify that the proctor was not interacting at all with the examinee or administration of the test.Data Analysis PlanGroup equivalence was first explored by comparing the KBIT-2 index and IQ composite scores (all of which were collected by traditional administration of the KBIT-2) of the two different groups (online vs. traditional administration of the WISC-V groups), using both significance tests (p values of t tests) and Cohen’s d. The standards of p ≥ .05 and d < 0.2 (in accordance with the recommendation of Cohen, 1988) were used as the standard for equivalence of the independent groups. Cohen’s d is calculated as the difference between mean scores on the two different administration formats, divided by the pooled standard deviation of scores.Then, participants were paired on the KBIT-2 IQ composite, to create more specific paired comparisons by IQ level. The whole sample (N = 273) was sorted and matched on the KBIT-2 IQ composite. Of the entire sample, 85 in-person/online pairs (N = 170; 62.3% of the sample) were able to be matched exactly on the IQ composite. Another 20 pairs (N = 40; 14.7% of the sample) were able to be matched within an IQ composite score difference of 1. For each of these pairs, they were counterbalanced with another pair, such that one had an IQ composite difference of 1 with online administration higher, and one had an IQ composite difference of 1 with in-person administration higher. Another 20 pairs (N = 40; 14.7% of the sample) were matched the same way, but with an IQ composite difference greater than 1, but still counterbalanced by administration method. Another three pairs (N = 6; 2.2% of the sample) were identified and matched to ensure that IQ composite scores at the extremes were included, and these three pairs were counterbalanced together (such that one pair had a difference of 24, with online administration being higher, and the other two pairs had differences of 9 and 15, with in-person administration being higher). Seventeen cases (6.2% of the sample), primarily from the average IQ range, were left unmatched in the final sample and were excluded from analyses (see Table 1 in the online supplemental materials for information on excluded cases). This process resulted in a final analysis sample of 128 pairs (N = 256).To evaluate equivalence in the current study, a two-one-sided-tests (TOST) procedure was employed (Lakens, 2017; Richter & Richter, 2002; Schuirmann, 1987; Seaman & Serlin, 1998). The TOST is a stringent analysis (more so than a t test or using the minimally detectable difference) that uses a confidence interval (CI) within a predefined bound, called the smallest effect size of interest (SESOI), to determine that two conditions’ measured differences are statistically negligible, and thus the conditions are equivalent. The TOST procedure uses a 90% CI to test for equivalence at the p = .05 level. While some have advocated that the SESOI for health and psychosocial factors should equal 0.5 SD (Norman, Sloan, & Wyrwich, 2003), the present study utilized a more stringent metric, opting for 0.3 SD, widely used to represent a low effect size. This stricter SESOI is a far narrower difference than the precision of the scores themselves, based on standard error of measurement (see Wechsler, 2014b, p. 61). As such, for index scores (M = 100, SD = 15), the 90% CI (Richter & Richter, 2002) of the paired difference between traditional, in-person administration and remote, online administration must fall between a lower bound of −4.5 and an upper bound of 4.5 (90% CI [–4.5, 4.5]) to be considered equivalent (at an alpha of .05). For scaled scores (M = 10, SD = 3), the paired-difference CI must fall between a lower bound of −0.9 and an upper bound of 0.9 (90% CI [–0.9, 0.9]) to be considered equivalent.ResultsRandomization CheckGiven the case control matching by age and gender for the two groups, with random assignment, there would be no expectation of large or systematic differences between the groups. To confirm this, the KBIT-2 scores (given in identical administration formats) were analyzed for independent group differences (before pairing participants).

All of the indices’ CIs fall within the threshold for equivalence (−4.5, 4.5), demonstrating no significant effects of the difference in administration on scores. The difference score CIs for all subtest scores except one also fall within the threshold for equivalence (–.9, .9), again demonstrating no significant method effects. The exception is Letter–Number Sequencing, which revealed significantly higher scores for those who were administered the WISC-V in the traditional, in-person format, as compared to their remote, online counterparts.Tables 5TABLES AND FIGUREStable/figure thumbnailTable 5.

Intercorrelations of Core Subtest and Index Sores for the Remote, Online Administration GroupView larger image > in this page > in new window> Download slidepresent the intercorrelations between subtests and index scores on both the KBIT-2 (index scores only) and the WISC-V, separated by administration type. Similar patterns of intercorrelation emerge for the traditional, in-person group and the remote, online group. First, there are low to moderate correlations among all the subtests and indices, expected as all tasks measure at least to some degree a general intelligence factor (g). The subtest components that comprise the indices generally correlated as expected, more strongly with each other than with other subtests and indices. For example, for both administration groups, the Coding and Symbol Search subtests correlate moderately with each other, with the Processing Speed Index (which is expected, as they are included heavily in the calculation of it), and the Full-Scale IQ, with very low correlations with any other subtest or index. The similar intercorrelations suggest that the test data maintained their general factor structure in the remote, online administration procedure, when compared to traditional, in-person administration.To evaluate the statistical significance of any differences in correlations between the two administration procedures of the WISC-V, a modified asymptotic approach to calculating CIs for the difference between the nonoverlapping, dependent correlation coefficients was employed (Zou, 2007). Each WISC-V correlation was examined for significant difference between mode, and several correlations emerged as significantly different. However, these significant differences were generally either at the between-subtest level or the subtest-nonrelated-index level (see Table 2 in the online supplemental materials, presented with Fisher-z-transformed correlation coefficients). None of the correlations at the index and full-scale IQ level emerged with significant differences between administration methods. As such, the structure of the measure is generally equivalent between the two administration methods.DiscussionThe present study aimed to evaluate the equivalence of an online, remote administration procedure to traditional, in-person administration of the WISC-V. There were no exhibited method effects for the different modes of administration in this nonclinical sample on any index score or the full-scale IQ. Additionally, most subtests administered saw no significant difference by administration method, with the exception of Letter–Number Sequencing. This subtest is a supplemental subtest and does not contribute to the overall full-scale IQ or any index score. The results from this particular subtest, though, should be interpreted with caution. Specifically, results may represent a slight underestimate of scores that would be obtained from traditional, in-person administration of the test.No mediating mechanisms for potential differences were examined in the present study. As such, there is no way to know why scores differed on this subtest, despite the stimulus materials being among the more similar between methods (Letter–Number Sequencing uses only auditory stimuli). Many subtests with more obvious alteration in stimulus materials, such as Matrix Reasoning or Visual Puzzles (with the stimulus pictures digitized into the screen in front of them and situated in a different orientation than either the traditional administration or the Q-Interactive administration, both which present the stimuli lying flat on the desk in front of the student), were not affected by administration procedure. Further research is needed to determine the underlying mechanisms for these differences.While more data should be collected to compare the two administration methods, especially with specific clinical populations, the present study suggests that the scores elicited by the two different administration methods are mostly equivalent and interchangeable, and as such all the WISC-V normative and psychometric (reliability, validity, utility) research can be applied confidently to the new online, remote administration of the test.LimitationsThe present study has several significant limitations. The most important limitation is the generalizability of the sample. Specifically, the present study utilized a general school sample, rather than a sample from a specific clinical population, so generalizability is limited. Different clinical samples, however, may have specific interaction effects with the digital platform for the online, remote administration, which should be considered when interpreting scores in clinical populations. Similarly, the present study did not collect an abundance of demographic data, including racial and ethnic background, and the overwhelming majority of participants had parents with at least some college experience. It is not necessarily a nationally representative sample, though care was taken to recruit from different geographical regions.Further, the present study does not comment on the equivalence of all online, remote administrations of cognitive tests with their traditional, in-person analog. That is, the exhibited equivalence of this specific procedure for this specific test (the WISC-V) does not imply equivalence for another procedure used with the WISC-V, nor does it imply equivalence of online, remote administration of other tests. The online, remote administration of the WISC-V in the present study adhered to very specific, rigorous protocols (with regard to digital specifications, specific training for examiners and coaching of proctors, and standardized administration modifications). The equivalence of remote, online administration that does not adhere to these protocols has not been determined. However, especially when constraints are present, the results of remote, online administration of the WISC-V, even slightly outside of the administration procedures used in the present study, are likely to be useful and usable. Ethical interpretation of scores that emerge from even slight alterations in this standardized protocol require careful consideration (Wright et al., 2020).ConclusionOnline, remote administration of cognitive and intellectual tests like the WISC-V has the potential to significantly increase access to important evaluations. This is true during this COVID-19 crisis, during which a great deal of assessment has halted entirely, as well as during more “normal” times, when there are shortages and inequities of access to evaluation. Being able to test students online allows for a redistribution of resources within states, allowing for access in remote areas (without hours of travel time) and lightening of caseloads in more densely populated environments. Students who need psychoeducational evaluations should have them, even during a pandemic, and they should have them in a timely fashion. The remote, online use of the WISC-V can help achieve that goal. Telepsychology also called telemental health, or telebehavioral health is broadly defined as the delivery of behavioral health services via technological means, typically across a distance. Telepsychology can be performed in real time (synchronous) or as a delayed correspondence (asynchronous). Within large organizations such as the Department of Defense (DoD), Indian Health Service, and Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), video teleconferencing (VTC) is the most common means of telepsychology. Globally, telepsychology is used to deliver care to remote areas or postdisaster settings. For example, in 2010, telepsychology was leveraged to provide services to Haitians following a devastating earthquake (Augusterfer, Mollica, & Lavelle, 2015).An important aspect of telepsychology is its utilization in the provision of effective treatments to those at facilities where access to care is limited due to provider shortages and the uneven distribution of low density specialized providers (e.g., pediatric psychiatrists). Research on telepsychology has demonstrated favorable findings related to both process variables (i.e., satisfaction and rapport; Gros, Lancaster, López, & Acierno, 2018; Morland et al., 2015) and outcome variables (Bashshur, Shannon, Bashshur, & Yellowlees, 2016). High treatment acceptability and credibility has also been found with an older adult population (Egede et al., 2016). Randomized trials (Nelson, Barnard, & Cain 2003; O’Reilly et al., 2007; Ruskin et al., 2004) as well as less rigorous studies (Frueh et al., 2007; Tuerk, Yoder, Ruggiero, Gros, & Acierno, 2010) suggest telepsychology is generally as effective as face-to-face (FTF) psychotherapy (Shore et al., 2018) and psychiatry (Hubley, Lynch, Schneck, Thomas, & Shore, 2016). Similarly, evidence-based psychotherapies delivered via telepsychology have generally, though not universally, been found to produce comparable clinical outcomes (Gros et al., 2013). For example, a number of well-designed randomized noninferiority clinical trials have recently been completed in the VA system demonstrating comparable outcomes in telepsychology delivered via VTC and FTF therapy; this includes cognitive processing therapy (CPT) for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD; Morland et al., 2014), prolonged exposure for PTSD (Acierno et al., 2017), and behavioral activation and therapeutic exposure for PTSD (Acierno et al., 2016).However, telepsychology is not without limitations. While telepsychology is employed, in large part, to overcome conventional barriers to care, novel challenges inherent in technology-enhanced treatment present a new set of obstacles. These obstacles require unique ethical and legal considerations beyond those required to perform FTF clinical care; for example, the legal ability to provide services in both the location of the provider and the patient. For good reason, researchers and available resources have largely focused on the legal, regulatory, and ethical considerations pertinent to telepsychology (Glueckauf et al., 2018); for example, a telepsychology provider typically needs to be licensed to provide services both in the state where the provider is and the state where the client is at the time of services (in the military medical system providers need to have clinical privileges in both locations). These constraints are well addressed in other reviews and are beyond the scope of the current paper (Brooks, Turvey, & Augusterfer, 2013; Landry-Poole, Pujol, & Moore, 2017); however, information about the actual clinical practice of telepsychology is lacking.Regarding the logistical and practical delivery of telepsychology services, a survey of telepsychology experts found that adaptations to treatment protocols were recommended for three domains: use of self-report questionnaires, treatment handouts, and in-session examples (Gros et al., 2013). Use of objective standardized outcome tracking measures and self-monitoring logs (e.g., sleep logs) is a part of evidence-based assessment, which is a critical component of evidence-based practice (Beidas et al., 2015; Brewin, 2013). Historically, cognitive-behavioral therapists have been more open to telepsychology than their psychodynamic counterparts (Mora, Nevid, & Chaplin, 2008; Perle et al., 2013); they are also more likely to use treatment manuals in their practice (Becker, Smith, & Jensen-Doss, 2013). Further, a sizable portion of these manualized treatments have worksheets that are core components of the treatment (Shafran et al., 2009). Clinicians attempting to provide these therapies via telepsychology may find themselves confused about how to practically go about providing those services, as distributing and completing worksheets through telepsychology is logistically different than FTF care. The term “in-session examples” refers to the use of visual aids such as a whiteboard or diagram to illustrate a point, facilitate attentional practice, and aid in the evaluation of a treatment target (Beck & Haigh, 2014; Waltman, 2015).Suitable adaptations in the three recommended domains are demonstrated in the following case series in which telepsychology was utilized to deliver evidence-based treatments to an active duty military population. This case series will comprise three manualized therapies that include worksheets as a key component of treatment. A pharmacological treatment case will also be presented. The focus of these cases will be illustrating the adaptations to treatment protocols for the three domains that Gros and colleagues (2013) suggested (i.e., use of self-report questionnaires, treatment handouts, and in-session examples). Some details have been changed or omitted to maintain anonymity without impacting significant aspects of the case presentations. Informed consent was obtained from all individual participants included in the study.The treatment context for these cases is that these were all active duty service members who were treated in military hospitals via telepsychology by clinicians who were located at a different military hospital. Treatment referrals were made from the location where the service members (SMs) were located and cases were managed through the military health system. This model of telepsychology is different from the VA home-based telepsychology model where the client uses telepsychology from their home. In the military model, telepsychology is used to increase access to care and decrease problems related to provider shortages (Landry-Poole et al., 2017). In these settings, the client sits in a telepsychology room in a hospital and connects with a provider in a different hospital using VTC. There is some support staff available to help provide technical support, assist in appointment booking, and coordinate crisis response as needed. This makes the emergency procedures in these settings different than VA or non-VA settings, which will be reviewed below.CPT for PTSD via TelepsychologySergeant Smith (SGT S; pseudoname) was a noncommissioned officer with almost two decades of service, including five tours of combat. His position became emotionally more difficult when advances in technology allowed SGT S to see high-definition video footage of precision artillery strikes. He previously had never seen the carnage resulting from the attacks. He found himself haunted by these images and he would regularly have nightmares of what he saw.The military mental health system uses a web-hosted outcome measure service called Behavioral Health Data Portal (BHDP; Brewin, 2013). Screening and outcome tracking measures were administered via BHDP immediately prior to the telepsychology sessions. A clinical interview was conducted and SGT S met full criteria for a diagnosis of PTSD (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). The PTSD Checklist for DSM–5 (PCL-5; Weathers et al., 2013) was administered and he scored in the clinical range with a score of 66. Though SGT S had been exposed to multiple traumas, he was most distressed by the intrusive memories of those he had killed. A chief component of his PTSD symptoms was a prevailing sense of guilt and shame related to his combat experiences; this persistent sense of iniquity is commonly referred to as moral injury in the literature (Drescher et al., 2011). SGT S was presented with his treatment options and selected CPT (Resick, Monson, & Chard, 2007).CPT is a manualized cognitive-behavioral treatment for PTSD that has been recommended by the updated VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of PTSD (VA & DoD, 2017). A noninferiority trial demonstrated the CPT delivered via telepsychology can produce comparable outcomes to CPT delivered FTF (Morland et al., 2014). The goal of CPT is to foster cognitive modification. This involves coming to terms with what happened and integrating this new learning into the person’s belief set. This is typically accomplished through the use of a series of written thought records.The military version of the CPT manual is available electronically, allowing for worksheets and handouts to be digitally shared with the patient in session via screen-sharing technology. Sharing hard copies of handouts and worksheets with patients via telepsychology can be difficult as it relies on the patient having access to a working printer or the technician printing the handout for the patient (Gros et al., 2013). Worksheets and handouts can be directly sent to the client via encrypted e-mail when that is an option. Some providers also choose to mail a paper copy of worksheets to the client. Typically, before a first session, it is unclear which handouts will be needed with a new patient, and the patient receiving a handout from the technician prior to the session can interrupt the flow of therapy. Also, staffing changes, off-site factors, and responsiveness of the technician can affect the timeliness and availability of technicians to provide worksheets to patients on behalf of the therapist. To account for this, the therapist relied on screen-sharing technology and SGT S’s smart camera phone. The therapist had him take pictures of the computer monitor to capture handouts and the impact statement instructions to facilitate his homework. It is also hoped that taking a picture of the computer monitor will make it harder to lose the information, as people can misplace worksheets, but tend to not lose their smartphones.To aid with psychoeducation and to test his openness toward incorporating smartphone application technology into treatment, SGT S was provided with the VA application PTSD Coach. SGT S used the smartphone app to access high-quality psychoeducation materials, which he used to talk with his family about his PTSD. He responded well to the application, as there was some difficulty getting the paper CPT worksheets to the patient at the remote site. Consequently, he was introduced to an alternate resource in session. CPT Coach (Pospos et al., 2018; Shore et al., 2014) is a smartphone application that can be used as a supplement to psychotherapy with a therapist who is providing CPT. The CPT Coach application contains the worksheets and handouts from the CPT manual in a free smart phone app, which SGT S preferred as an alternative to hand-written worksheets.Within the application, SGT S was able to log his stuck points, view electronic copies of the handouts discussed, and complete thought logs to target his PTSD-related beliefs. In session, Socratic questioning was used to evaluate his stuck points; this involved a series of introspective questions to encourage help him break down his thoughts and come to new conclusions on his own. In lieu of a white board, screen-sharing technology allowed the therapist to share a blank word processor document that could be used to weigh evidence and break down concepts. For example, to address his belief that he was a monster we typed out on the shared screen our jointly derived definition of a monster and then used that to evaluate where he fit the definition. We also created a shared definition of the opposite construct: his being a good person. This definition was saved and whenever new evidence of his being a good person was encountered it was added to the word document in session. This accrual of evidence allowed for an aggregating effect on his stuck points and reduction in self-blame. This, paired with continued use of CPT worksheets housed in the CPT Coach app, allowed for his main stuck point to be addressed and restructured. SGT S’s PTSD symptoms gradually decreased to the subclinical range across eight sessions of CPT, with his initial PCL-5 score of 66 decreasing to a 23. He reported decreases in marital problems and increases in life satisfaction. Based on his improvements, he decided to not retire from military service and he extended his contract with the army. At follow up, his PTSD symptoms were still in the subclinical range.Collaborative Assessment and Management of Suicidality (CAMS) via TelepsychologyGros, Veronee, Strachan, Ruggiero, and Acierno (2011) and Gros et al. (2013) provide excellent descriptions on how to manage risk in home-based telepsychology. Captain C (CPT C; pseudoname) was a 28-year-old soldier with 7 years of service who presented as a medical referral for individual psychotherapy due to depressive symptoms. CPT C reported his persistent suicidal thoughts had recently increased in frequency and intensity in context of a breakup as well as mounting financial concerns and occupational stressors associated with a new position. He had recently begun drafting a suicide note and had purchased a pistol. BHDP (Brewin, 2013) was unavailable at the remote site at the time of the encounter so paper-and-pencil versions of the measures were administered and then scanned and sent via encrypted e-mail to the provider by a psychiatric technician. At intake, his score on the Patient Health Questionnaire (Löwe, Kroenke, Herzog, & Gräfe, 2004) was a 23 (severe depression), baseline Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS; Posner et al., 2011) was a 5 (lifetime thoughts of suicide with plan or actual behavior endorsed), and current C-SSRS was a 4 (past month thoughts of suicide with some intent endorsed). CPT C met criteria for major depressive disorder but the initial focus of clinical attention was suicidal ideation.The majority of the initial session was used to assess risk of harm to self; this was completed through use of the CAMS (Jobes, Moore, & O’Connor, 2007). CAMS is an evidence-based clinical approach for assessing, treating, and tracking suicidal risk. The framework is designed to strengthen the therapeutic alliance and to enhance patient motivation through a highly interactive assessment process that is guided by a tool called the Suicide Status Form (SSF; Jobes, 2006). The SSF uses Likert and qualitative items to assess psychological pain, stress, agitation, hopelessness, self-hate, and overall suicide risk. Traditionally CAMS is performed with the clinician sitting side by side with the patient, and the SSF is handed back and forth between the dyad during the assessment.Prior to beginning the intake session with the patient, the initial SSF was sent from the provider to the technician at the remote site based on the positive suicide screen. Following introductions and consents, CAMS was introduced to the patient. The traditional protocol was discussed as well as the necessary adaptations to conduct the treatment through telepsychology. Specifically, the patient was told a single SSF was meant to be shared and coauthored by the patient and clinician, but would be completed together on two separate copies by each participant during session. As CPT C discussed the constructs and wrote responses on his copy of the form, the clinician wrote the same responses on her copy. In a traditional face-to-face session, this process usually takes 10–15 min. An additional 5–10 min was needed in the telepsychology session to ensure the dyad was accurately recording identical responses.The interim SSF tracking sheets were completed in the same fashion at each encounter. The provider would e-mail the form to the technician at the remote site, and the technician would print the form and provide it to the patient before he entered the treatment room. Information gleaned from the qualitative responses on the SSF was used to inform treatment interventions in subsequent sessions. The treatment plan and crisis response plan were similarly updated as necessary. At the conclusion of each session, CPT C and the provider kept their own copy of the form, and the therapist’s worksheet was uploaded into the soldier’s electronic medical record for documentation purposes.The first several sessions were marked by significant declines in severity ratings on the tracking sheets. After five sessions, CPT C was no longer reporting suicidal thoughts. The subsequent session focused on understanding warning signs for possible future episodes of suicidal ideation and additional coping skills to address inevitable life stressors. During the final session, the final SSF was compared side by side with the initial SSF to serve as a visual aid of the patient’s treatment progress.Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia via TelepsychologySpecialist Martinez (SPC M; pseudoname) was a 29-year-old enlisted service member with 3 years of service who presented with symptoms of anxiety and sleep disturbance after sustaining injuries as a result of a physical assault by her husband. Following the assault, she began psychotherapy with a telepsychology psychotherapy provider and telepsychology prescribing psychologist. Trials of two medications for sleep were unsuccessful due to next-day sedation, so she was referred to a cognitive-behavioral treatment of insomnia (CBT-I) group delivered through telepsychology.CBT-I is an evidence-based treatment that has been shown to be effective for individuals with insomnia. Reviews of the literature show that CBT-I is a standard of care treatment for chronic and severe insomnia (e.g., Morin et al., 1999), with clinical gains that last over the long term. The original protocol described by Perlis, Jungquist, Smith, and Posner (2005) is delivered over eight sessions and contains presentation of the rationale for the treatment, sleep hygiene guidelines (e.g., maintain a regular sleep schedule, avoid alcohol in the evening), diaphragmatic breathing, relaxation strategies, and worry control in later sessions. Sleep diaries are used to calculate sleep efficiency, or the amount of time one is sleeping while in bed, which is ideally in the low 90 percentiles. Importantly, individuals undergoing CBT-I are given a sleep schedule to promote consolidated sleep that initially begins with “prescribing” time in bed to be no more than the average time asleep over 2 weeks according to the sleep diary. Few studies have reported using telehealth for delivery of CBT-I, but one study reported positive results with group CBT-I delivered to veterans (Gehrman, Shah, Miles, Kuna, & Godleski, 2016).Group CBT-ISPC M initially engaged in group CBT-I through telepsychology. She was one of six members of a group that met in a conference room with a large-screen TV. The psychologist facilitator of the 5-week, 1.5-hr/week group originated a video-conferencing call to the conference room where participants sat around a large table. During the first session, SPC M told group members that she slept between 4 and 6 hr, on average, per night and her goal was to sleep 8 hr/night. Screen sharing technology was used to show a brief PowerPoint slides presentation relevant to each group session topic. Group success relied on a behavioral health technician at the receiving site to set up the technology, deliver packets of information used for the group, and be available in case of technology glitch. In subsequent groups, the technician collected sleep diaries from participants, scanned and sent them to the group facilitator via encrypted e-mail at the beginning of each group. An electronic sleep diary embedded in a smart phone application called CBT-I Coach developed by the Veteran’s Administration and the Telemedicine and Advanced Technology Research Center (TATRC) can be used to record daily diaries and transmit the compiled information directly to the provider, but this application could not be used in this instance because of installation security concerns of nonencrypted transmission.The second through fifth groups followed a brief CBT-I protocol. Participants were encouraged to use Breathe to Relax, a smart phone application, also developed by TATRC, to practice diaphragmatic breathing daily. SPC M reported early gains in sleep efficiency during the first 2 weeks in the group that were not maintained during the last two groups. She ended with a sleep efficiency of 80.5% and a total sleep time of 6 hr and requested an individual therapist to continue CBT-I.Individual CBT-IAt intake, SPC M’s anxiety had heightened and she endorsed a suicidal wish to die within the last month, which she indicated was “not a real wish to die,” but a “wish my problems would go away.” She and her primary therapist were working on these problems in weekly psychotherapy, but both agreed she should continue CBT-I. She was also taking hydroxyzine (25 mg) as needed for acute anxiety, but denied using it prior to bedtime. During the intake, screen sharing was used to reinforce how to fill out a sleep diary and to show her a colorful list of sleep hygiene guidelines. She indicated difficulties with nocturnal awakenings when a roommate came in during the night. She described two nightmares/month related to the physical assault and noted functional difficulties during the day. She estimated receiving 6.5 hr of sleep per night with a latency of greater than 60 min and described functional difficulties at work (e.g., falling asleep at work, yawning often, and reduced attention and concentration).Over the course of three follow-up sessions conducted over 6 weeks, SPC M kept her sleep diary consistently and gained skills calculating her own sleep efficiency. She learned to use problem solving to address nocturnal awakenings, some of which she discovered were due to hip pain, which she addressed with her primary care practitioner. With concomitant psychotherapy, her nightmares ceased. Her sleep efficiency grew from 82% to 97% at the end of treatment and she was able to reach her goal of an average of 7.5 hr of sleep/night. Her scores on the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI; Bastien, Vallières, & Morin, 2001; administered via BHDP; Brewin, 2013) decreased from the clinical insomnia range (ISI = 17; moderate severity) at the beginning of the group to a subthreshold range (ISI = 11) over the course of treatment.This example of CBT-I in the group and individual setting illustrates the use of screen sharing technology and of treatment-related phone applications. Because of security and privacy concerns with unencrypted transmission in a military population, the sleep diary in the CBT-I Coach was not used. Transmission of the sleep diary in this setting required a behavioral health technician to send the document through encrypted e-mail. Especially in the group setting when patients may arrive at different times prior to the group (i.e., some close to the start time of the group), there can be interruption from this transmission in group start times while the provider accesses the e-mail and prints the diary at one end and the hard copy is returned to the patient in the group at the other. Another issue with using telepsychology in the group setting, in general, is that real-time interactions are not mimicked as well for the leader. That is, when a person speaks, the static camera does not move to track who is speaking and focus on that person as experienced in a FTF group. Our organization subsequently tested a more sophisticated system with voice and movement tracking that was able to simulate a group more fully. However, this system is not without its downsides in that it took some time for participants to adjust to the camera moving to focus on them when they spoke. SPC M adapted to the telepsychology setting well. This example highlights the successful delivery of CBT-I through telepsychology in both group and individual settings.Pharmacotherapy for PTSD via TelepsychologyFirst Lieutenant Reynolds (1LT R; pseudoname) was a 27-year-old Army infantry officer with less than 2 years of military service who presented for a medication evaluation. He reported symptoms of depression, irritability, and sleep difficulties connected to his combat deployment to Afghanistan. 1LT R’s deployment occurred less than 9 months following his arrival to his first duty station. As an infantry officer, 1LT R led an infantry platoon on over a hundred combat missions in hostile villages across Afghanistan. Exposed to multiple traumatic events during his deployment, within months of returning home, 1LT R manifested many symptoms associated with PTSD to include intrusive thoughts, dysphoric mood, hyperarousal, hypervigilance, and nightmares. His score on the PCL-5 was 63 at intake and he was formally diagnosed with PTSD.Prior to presenting for a medication evaluation, 1LT R had completed a partial course (5 sessions) of prolonged exposure therapy. Although he acknowledged that the therapy was helpful, he found it subjectively too difficult to “constantly talk about what happened” and became frustrated with having to take time off from work every week for treatment. He felt that pharmacotherapy would be a better treatment option for him.1LT R was prescribed sertraline 50 mg daily for his global symptoms of PTSD and prazosin 1 mg each night for his nightmares. Sertraline is a first-line pharmacological intervention for PTSD and is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the disorder. Prazosin is an alpha-adrenergic antagonist that was originally developed to treat hypertension. However, a number of clinical trials have shown it to be effective at reducing nightmares (Aurora et al., 2010; Nappi, Drummond, & Hall, 2012), although recent concerns have been raised regarding its efficacy (Raskind et al., 2018). Prazosin is not FDA approved for nightmares or PTSD. During the maintenance phase of treatment, 1LT R reached a dose of 150 mg of sertraline and 5 mg of prazosin. He also took over-the-counter melatonin on an as-needed basis.In addition to dealing with PTSD, 1LT R was also suffering from back and neck pain and migraines related to an injury he sustained during his deployment. Consequently, he was prescribed a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory (back and neck) and a triptan (migraines) by his primary care manager. Prior to prescribing medication for his PTSD, a discussion about the potential risks associated with drug-drug interactions occurred. 1LT R and the prescribing psychologist discussed the increased risk of internal bleeding and serotonin toxicity related to his medication regimen (common risks associated with serotonergic antidepressants and medications regularly used for pain management). During the discussion, the drug interaction program Lexicomp was used and the results were shared with the patient virtually. Lexicomp is an online tool that provides important information about potential interactions between medications and offers suggestions to prevent interactions from occurring. Similar programs are available at no cost to the user. As noted in the first case study, telepsychology providers have the capacity to share their computer screen images with their patients. Sharing the details of potential drug-drug interactions visually with the patient resulted in a more thorough and thoughtful discussion regarding potential interactions compared to a typical one-sided psychoeducational exchange. 1LT R stated, “I appreciate you reviewing these potential interactions in detail. If I had not seen them I probably would have forgotten what you said.” In this provider’s experience (author BAM), similar feedback from other patients is common. Discussions about potential drug-drug interactions is important in psychopharmacological practice, however, the level of retention and understanding of this material by patients is oftentimes uncertain. Seeing this key information “on screen” during the discussion appears to increase understanding and retention.In addition to psychoeducation regarding potential drug-drug interactions, through the same screen-sharing process used for the drug information session, data were shared virtually with 1LT R regarding his progress. The BHDP tracks serial assessments of a variety of instruments to include the PCL-5. Each session 1LT R was able to see his current PCL-5 score and compare it to past scores. Over the course of 9 months he had 12 unique PCL-5 scores, which trended downward with the highest score being at the time of evaluation (63) and his lowest score being at Session 12 (28). Session 12 was the last session of the maintenance phase of treatment. 1LT Reynolds found the ability to track the trajectory of his scores to be highly reinforcing. At one point he stated:When I can see my scores on the screen and watch how the scores go down over time, it becomes like a game for me. It makes me want to see how far I can go . . . how low I can get my scores . . . how quickly I can get better.Research has shown that routine use of outcome measures, and the sharing of the results of those outcome measures, increases patient treatment adherence and improves outcomes (Lambert, 2013). Handouts were not used with this patient.DiscussionAn advantage of telepsychology is the increased ability to provide services to patients in low resourced environments (Landry-Poole et al., 2017). This can also decrease the time costs of attending treatment as the individuals treated in this study did not have to venture away from work to receive care. Further, telepsychology allowed for people in need of research-supported treatment interventions to receive quality treatments from providers who were several hours away. Consistent with previous research findings, delivering manualized treatments via telepsychology can be just as effective as FTF care (Shore et al., 2018); however, as noted in the introduction, adaptations to VTC are needed. The above cases illustrate the commonly used adaptations well (Table 1).TABLES AND FIGUREStable/figure thumbnailTable 1. Observed Adaptations to TelepsychologyView larger image > in this page > in new window> Download slideSelf-Report QuestionnairesThe use of self-report questionnaires (e.g., objective standardized outcome tracking measures and self-monitoring logs) is a part of evidence-based assessment, which is a critical component of evidence-based practice (Beidas et al., 2015; Brewin, 2013). Administering self-report questionnaires from a distance via telepsychology is different than being FTF, but there are several workable solutions.As illustrated in the CBT-I case example, measures like sleep logs can be filled out on paper forms and then scanned and transmitted through encrypted messenger or emails. This process requires planning ahead and is not feasible for every provider or setting. Some of the smartphone applications discussed above have embedded self-report questionnaires and tracking measures, but there are questions about transmitting the data from the applications to the therapist in a secure manner. As an alternative option, a patient could use the measure in the application and read the clinician a summary. For example, the sleep log in the CBT-I coach will calculate an overall sleep efficiency quotient. A patient could describe his week and then verbally provide the summary figures from the applications. That sleep efficiency figure can then be used to inform that week’s sleep schedule recommendations.Alternatively, patients may take the standardized measures online through secure web-based assessment surveys, such as BHDP described above. A number of web-based practice management programs allow for the secure transmission and collection of standardized measures and questionnaires but require foreplanning and coordination. Of course, HIPAA concerns would necessitate a business associate agreement and reputable companies will easily be able to provide these to consumers. The above cases benefitted from having a paraprofessional psychiatric technician on site with the patients to help facilitate the BHDP process. If this process was conducted without a technician’s help, clientele would need to be trained to complete the web-based surveys, which might be more difficult for some patients than others. There are alternative procedures that can be used.When having the patient complete the web-based survey prior to the session is not feasible, the measure may be verbally administered during the session. This will take up some of the session time and may force a clinician to be more judicious about which outcome-tracking measures are utilized. Additionally, there are considerations about whether verbal administration of a measure affects item response, or if this method of administration is in keeping with measure standardization procedures. Future research may look at this topic to inform clinical practice. A list of free and psychometrically sound outcome measures can be found in a previous review (Beidas et al., 2015). As illustrated in the final case example, incorporating outcome tracking into the active components of treatment can enhance clinical outcomes, this being consistent with previous findings (Lambert, 2013).Treatment HandoutsTreatment handouts and worksheets are a common component of manualized treatments (Shafran et al., 2009). Treatment handouts can be transmitted electronically, printed, filled out by hand, scanned, and sent back electronically. An additional option is that a treatment packet or patient manual can be mailed to the client or facility where the client is being seen to facilitate treatment—this strategy does require extra effort but it is a reliable method. A key take away is that using handouts in telepsychology requires forethought and planning—it is harder to be spontaneous with forms being used in telepsychology. In some cases, digital copies can be used; however, they are not always available and copyrights may limit a clinician’s ability to create a digital copy of an extant form from a treatment manual.Conceptually, there is a difference between handouts and worksheets. Handouts are informational and easier to use with screen-sharing technology or when using secure e-mail. In the above cases, the providers used screen sharing to share a number of different figures, but this is different from having a handout someone can physically take away with them. A low cost solution is to have the patient take a picture of the screen to capture the information. Software-based solutions such as screen shots might also be workable solutions, depending on whether or not it is a shared device. Additionally, a photograph of a shared screen or a screen shot could be printed for later use.Many of the newer smart phone applications (e.g., CPT Coach and CBT-I Coach) described above have the treatment handouts embedded in the application. Notably, these mobile health apps were developed by the VA or Defense Health Agency, and so they are secure and free to use. The user’s data is stored on their own device and many of these apps allow for personal identification number locking of the apps data. In these cases, one can reference the application and go over it together with the information already contained in their phones. The CPT Coach app also has an embedded ABC worksheet function that can be used as a thought record if verbally reviewed together. The patient described in the first case preferred this over the paper ABC worksheets as he was less worried about losing it or leaving it out where someone else might read it.Some manualized treatments specify how the handouts are to be used. This requires careful accommodation when utilizing telepsychology. For example, in CAMS the dyad is supposed to collaboratively fill out the forms together. This can be difficult from a distance but the above case illustrates how planning can allow for the therapist and patient to each have their own copy of requisite forms that they complete together.In-Session ExamplesUse of in-session examples can help increase the attentional focus on the information being discussed and the intervention being used (Beck & Haigh, 2014). This is most often completed through use of screen-sharing technology that is a core function in most telepsychology VTC software. When digital copies of forms are illustrations or figures are available, they can be shared via screen sharing. When the provider needs to create something novel, a blank word processor document can be used as a white board to track or list out the items that might normally be written out in session. In the CPT example, the therapist used this white board function to list out a shared definition of what it meant to be a monster and what it meant to be a good person. Other common software applications can be used as a white board with screen sharing. For example, the common paint applications (e.g., Microsoft Paint, Corel Painter, Krita, MyPaint; SketchBook) can be used to sketch out a concept like a habituation curve. Additionally, screen sharing an Internet search engine can allow for some new in-session example options as the clinician and patient directly research topics together. For example, if a patient is exceedingly hopeless, thinking they cannot go on after a major setback, a provider could look up stories about people who had similar setbacks and went on to have meaningful and happy lives. Providers might choose to address web browser settings so that previous search terms do not autopopulate the search field.Other ConsiderationsThere may need to be additional modifications and considerations for group therapies. In the CBT-I case example, the group facilitator noted a limitation with the technology. A static camera did not focus on the person who was speaking and a camera that focused in on motion had a lag time. Alterations in the pacing and practice of delivering group evidence-based treatments via telepsychology are likely required. Further research and innovation on the topic are needed.Additional considerations include patient access to a working printer and scanner. This might not be a static variable and having a backup plan for when technology fails is a requirement in telepsychology care (Landry-Poole et al., 2017). The key is to be flexible and think ahead wherever possible.The setting where the telepsychology occurs is another consideration; some of the strategies discussed above may need to be modified to suit the needs and resources of different treatment systems of care. Active duty military hospitals have different procedures, than VA home-based telepsychology. VA homebased providers have safety procedures that start before the first session where there is an initial thorough safety screen regarding the suitability and safety of the homebased setting and the risk and protective factors of the clients being served to ensure that telepsychology is an appropriate option. Risk management continues in on ongoing manner, where at the start of the session they verify the physical location of the client so they know where to dispatch emergency services if needed, they verify the callback phone number in case they get disconnected, and they verify the phone number of the emergency contact. In military hospitals, the client is already in a hospital and on-site support staff can physically assist in an emergency.Both of these procedures can be different from what a psychologist in independent practice might do, and other health systems might have other resources and limitations. Psychologists in independent practice will need to attend to practical and legal matters that we have not elaborated on: these include licensing requirements, HIPAA considerations, and practical considerations related to elements like screen sharing. Brooks and colleagues (2013) have a good review of how to overcome some of the common barriers that exist. Also, the scientific principle or using a pilot study or test run to find and work out potential barriers can be useful. We have attempted to draw out and demonstrate a variety of ideas and principles such that some, but not all, of this might be applicable depending on the setting and available resources. Further innovation is likely to be needed, as creativity and pragmatism is a hallmark of telepsychology. Clinicians in various settings are encouraged to follow the recommendations of Gros et al. (2013) and to make careful adaptations to the following domains use of self-report questionnaires, treatment handouts, and in-session examples, to ensure high quality care is being delivered.Summary and Future DirectionsEvidence-based psychotherapies and pharmacological therapies can be delivered effectively through telepsychology; this is well established in the literature. A recent survey of telepsychology experts demonstrated the need for guidance on how to adapt these practices for telepsychology with a specific focus on three domains: use of self-report questionnaires, treatment handouts, and in-session examples (Gros et al., 2013). The case series above demonstrated feasible workable solutions to address these domains of treatment. Further research and innovation on the topic is needed. Treatment developers may wish to provide guidance on the topic; additionally, they may choose to make available digital materials that can be used in telepsychology to facilitate the intended treatment effects. Research funders may choose to offer grant funding to study and develop adaptations to existing treatment protocols for telepsychology. These cases demonstrate the value of high quality smart phone applications (e.g., PTSD Coach, CPT Coach, PE Coach, CBT-I Coach; Pospos et al., 2018; Shore et al., 2014) that can be used in conjunction with telepsychology to help address the three different domains. Further research on how to best use these applications is needed and development of additional applications will also likely be needed. Journal editors may seek to solicit and publish more practice-focused literature on the topic of adapting evidence-based care to telepsychology settings to further clarify this process for front-line telepsychology clinicians. Graduate-level and postgraduate-level training programs may choose to include supervised training in these adaptations as telepsychology is a growing field of practice.Statement of Human RightsAll procedures performed in studies involving human participants were in accordance with the ethical standards of the institutional and/or national research committee (include name of committee + reference number) and with the 1964 Helsinki declaration and its later amendments or comparable ethical standards. Child-onset disruptive behavior disorders (DBDs) are characterized by oppositional and defiant behaviors, impulsivity, and aggression (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). Young children with behavioral challenges incur considerable costs to society (Moffitt, Caspi, Harrington, & Milne, 2002; Rivenbark et al., 2018). These children are at high risk for continued conduct problems and antisocial problems well into adolescence and adulthood (Babinski, Hartsough, & Lambert, 1999; Lee & Hinshaw, 2004; Mordre, Groholt, Kjelsberg, Sandstad, & Myhre, 2011; Sibley et al., 2011). Recently, Galán, Wang, Shaw, and Forbes (2019) conducted a follow-up study of young children through adolescence and adulthood and found that early onset behavioral challenges were predictive of violent behavior in adolescence and adulthood, adolescent correlates of antisocial behavior, and internalizing problems in adulthood. This study further found that those children with chronic, early problems were at highest risk for multiple types of difficulties during adolescence and adulthood including violent behavior, depression, and anxiety symptoms. Similarly, Rivenbark et al. (2018) found that although young children with early onset and chronic behavioral problems account for only 9% of the population, they account for approximately 53% of criminal convictions, 16% of emergency department visits, and 20% of medical prescriptions in adulthood. These data point to the early childhood period as an important window of opportunity to intervene in the lives of young children with behavioral problems.Behavioral parent training (BPT) is the most well-studied and efficacious psychosocial intervention for school-age children with DBDs (Chacko et al., 2017). This intervention is based on social interaction theory, which suggests that parents and children engage in a coercive cycle in which both escalate their aversive behavior until one party gives in, which reinforces child noncompliance as well as ineffective parenting techniques (Granic & Patterson, 2006; Patterson, 1982). In BPT, parents and caregivers are taught to lessen the intensity of this coercive cycle by using reinforcement and limit setting skills to simultaneously reduce misbehavior while increasing incompatible “positive-opposite” behavior. Core skills taught include praise, play, direct commands, and time-out (Chorpita & Daleiden, 2009). Implementation of BPT as a first-line intervention is critical in order to improve the lives of youth with DBDs and reduce familial and societal burden (Kaminski & Claussen, 2017).Graduate programs increased emphasis on evidence-based interventions (EBIs) and state requirements for, and availability of, continuing education courses have led to increased opportunities for training in EBIs. However, data suggest that graduate school training in EBIs for childhood psychiatric disorders is relatively rare when compared with adult-focused EBIs (Pidano & Whitcomb, 2012). Moreover, although individual training elements (i.e., didactics, ongoing consultation, and feedback) are often utilized in graduate training, their combination, which is considered best practices (Edmunds, Beidas, & Kendall, 2013; Herschell, Kolko, Baumann, & Davis, 2010), is less common. Continuing education courses typically focus on didactics and immediate hands-on practice (role-plays) but are rarely individualized and ongoing consultation is not often provided. However, having consultants physically available for training and ongoing consultation is not typically feasible, due in large part to funding and time constraints (Fixsen, Blase, Duda, Naoom, & Van Dyke, 2010).New technologies provide opportunities to increase the accessibility of high-quality training (Barnett, 2011; Kazdin & Blase, 2011). In particular, online clinician training offers several advantages to traditional methods, including 24-hr access, customization (e.g., self-paced, allowing for repetition and review), opportunity for interactive exercises, and multimedia training components (audio, video, animation, etc.), all of which have been shown to enhance knowledge retention (Khanna & Kendall, 2015; Zhang, 2005). Research has found that using interactive, web-based tutorials combined with live remote coaching can significantly improve therapeutic skills (Kobak, Opler, & Engelhardt, 2007) and knowledge (Brennan, Sellmaier, Jivanjee, & Grover, 2018).The purpose of the present pilot study was to develop and test a technological platform for training mental health professionals in BPT. This training is innovative in that it paired an online tutorial on BPT’s theoretical principles and four core skills (i.e., praise, play, commands, and time-out) with live remote coaching and role-plays with a trainer in order to maximize participant knowledge and skill acquisition. This project is significant because there is a general dearth of research on the efficacy of online training of psychological interventions, and in particular, despite their increasing usage, little data exist on the efficacy of hybrid training models. Finally, and perhaps most important, no web-based therapist training course that combines these two components and focuses specifically on BPT for DBDs has been tested. The aspects of individualization of the training, immediate tailored feedback, and ongoing consultation are essential to the training intervention that we have developed and offers a distinct opportunity for both students and clinicians. Pilot studies, such as this one, are crucial first steps toward evaluating whether these training models can lead to markedly higher penetration rates of evidence-based practice.The aims of the study were to evaluate whether the web platform operated successfully, participants found the content satisfactory, and participants’ knowledge of BPT principles and skill improved. Finding preliminary evidence that our training is feasible and acceptable would serve as a first step toward increasing dissemination of BPT training to mental health professionals, thereby increasing treatment availability for parents of children with disruptive behaviors. Initial findings suggesting that we can improve clinicians’ ability to conduct BPT would also lend support for conducting a larger trial to determine whether clinicians who received the training could demonstrate improved outcomes in their clients’ parenting skills as well as improvements in their clients’ children’s disruptive behaviors.MethodParticipantsAs shown in Table 1,TABLES AND FIGUREStable/figure thumbnailTable 1. Demographic CharacteristicsView larger image > in this page > in new window> Download slidethe 26 participants who enrolled and provided consent were primarily female (n = 19; 73.1%), White (n = 21; 80.8%), and, on average, 29.7 years of age (SD = 7.3 years). Half had a bachelor’s degree (n = 13), seven (26.9%) had a doctoral-level degree, and six (23.1%) had a master’s degree. The sample had, on average, 4.15 years (SD = 5.82) of clinical experience, and 16 participants (61.5%) were enrolled in graduate school at the time of the study. The majority of the sample (n = 20; 76.9%) had no prior formal training in BPT.ProcedureInstitutional review board approval was obtained for this study and recruitment occurred between January 30, 2018, and June 28, 2018. Potential participants were recruited through professional listservs and by e-mail announcements to clinical psychology doctoral students at Long Island University Post and New York University. Interested individuals contacted a designated member of the investigative team who determined eligibility and secured informed consent via electronic signature. Eligibility criteria included adults who were practicing clinicians or graduate students in psychology or social work.Thirty-one people expressed interest in participating in this pretest–posttest open trial and signed consent forms allowing us to send them links to pretraining assessments. Of that number, 26 people completed pretest assessment materials and began the online tutorial. Twenty-two participants completed the online tutorial and 21 subsequently met with a BPT trainer for three video conference coaching sessions (one participant who completed the online tutorial did not complete the coaching sessions or the posttest).Pre- and posttraining assessment of didactic knowledge and clinical skillsAs shown in Figure 1,TABLES AND FIGUREStable/figure thumbnailFigure 1. Participant Procedure.View larger image > in this page > in new window> Download slideonce enrolled, but before accessing the online materials, participants completed the Didactic Knowledge Questionnaire on their knowledge of BPT concepts and principles. We also assessed their clinical skills in conducting BPT with a mock caregiver, who was a member of the research team. Because trainees were located in diverse areas of the country, a web-based interface (Zoom) was used to conduct and record the pre- and posttest of trainee clinical skills. During these video-recorded role-plays, participants were asked to describe the theory underlying four BPT skills (nondirective play, praise, time-out, and commands), teach the components of each skill to the mock caregiver, and role-play administering the skills as if the participant was the caregiver of a child with a DBD (the trainer played a mock child). Each pretest (and subsequent posttest) assessment video of clinical skill was edited by a single member of the research team to remove all evidence of whether it occurred before or after the training. For example, if a research participant remarked that it was nice to see the research team member again, that segment of the video was deleted. Videos were then randomly assigned to the other research team members, who were blind to pretest or posttest recording status. Each video was scored by a single research team member with the BPT skills checklist and the adapted Fidelity of Implementation Rating System (FIMP) continuous rating (descriptions in measures section). Before videos were scored, team members had practiced on mock video segments. Given the structure of the FIMP and the BPT skills checklist, research team members quickly converged on a high level of interrater reliability (all research team members obtained Cohen’s kappas and intraclass correlation coefficients of >.8 for BPT skills checklists and FIMP ratings, respectively) before scoring videos used for data analysis.After completion of the pretest assessment of knowledge and the role-play, participants were sent a link to access the online tutorial. After completion of the online tutorial, participants completed the System Usability Scale (SUS) and User Satisfaction Questionnaire (USQ; descriptions in measures section) and once again completed the Didactic Knowledge Questionnaire. They then engaged in three live video conference practice coaching sessions (described in the next section) with a BPT trainer who was the same individual who served as the mock caregiver in the pretest. Once the live coaching sessions were completed, the participant completed a posttest role-play assessment identical to the pretest assessment with the same BPT trainer, who again served as a mock caregiver. Participants also completed the Evaluation of Applied Training Scale (EATS; description in measures section) measure of satisfaction with the live training.Online didactic tutorialThe online tutorial contained 10 modules covering the theoretical principles underlying BPT, key features on each of the four skills covered (labeled praise, positive play, commands, and time-out) and how to effectively teach these skills to caregivers (see Appendix A of the online supplemental materials for a complete description of course content and learning objectives). We determined which BPT skills to include in the online tutorial by reviewing efficacious BPT manuals for parents of young children and selecting skills commonly practiced across these interventions. Second, we compared our list with a study that used a distilling and matching model to determine common practice elements across randomized child treatment trials, including those focused on child behavior problems (Chorpita & Daleiden, 2009). In line with BPT manuals, praise was defined as rewarding a child with verbal and nonverbal approval as a method of reinforcing target behaviors. Participants learned the rationale for emphasizing praise over punishment as well as strategies for effectively praising children (e.g., praising immediately after a target behavior). Play focused on a set of strategies (e.g., reflecting a child’s words, avoiding commands and questions) for shifting caregiver attention from unwanted behaviors to those they wished to increase as well as improving the quality of caregiver–child interactions. Participants were also taught how to help parents effectively structure playtimes and ignore undesired behaviors. Commands were defined as prompts designed to elicit child compliance, followed by contingent reinforcement. Finally, a time-out from reinforcement was taught as a more effective punishment procedure than corporal punishment strategies. Participants learned how to identify target behaviors for time-out, the sequence of steps to follow to carry out the procedure effectively, and how to handle child noncompliance during time-out.Studies have found that high levels of interactivity, multimodel learning, and ongoing self-tests enhance knowledge retention in online training (Brennan et al., 2018). Thus, the tutorial contains interactive exercises, animated graphics, ongoing interactive self-tests, and video examples of techniques in a multimodal, multimedia, interactive learning approach (visit http://telepsychology.net/BPT_Default.aspx to access the online tutorial).Live remote coachingBecause didactic training alone is insufficient for acquiring new clinical skills, providing an opportunity for trainees to practice applying these skills was a critical component of the training (Washburn et al., 2019). The primary goal of the 60-min coaching sessions was to reinforce knowledge learned in the tutorial and provide opportunities to model and role-play the use of the skills. To do this, the trainer pretended to be a parent seeking help with a disruptive child and the research subject acted as the therapist. Session 1 focused on praise and play, Session 2 focused on commands and time-out, and Session 3 was flexible, allowing each trainer and participant pair to determine what content was most important to discuss and practice. In Sessions 1 and 2, trainers asked whether the participants had questions about the skill and then asked how the participant thought the skill fit within an operant-conditioning/social-learning model and helped to clarify their understanding. Participants were encouraged to discuss how the skill fit with other previously discussed skills (e.g., how does time-out fit with praise within an operant-conditioning/social-learning model?). Next, trainers focused on three components: the rationale for each skill, how to teach caregivers each skill, and how to role-play each skill with caregivers. Participants were taught the rationale for each skill in order to learn how to explain the purpose of the skill to caregivers, which would likely increase buy in. They then learned how to teach caregivers didactics on specific components of each skill to ensure they could thoroughly describe each step of the skill to clients. Finally, they learned how to role-play to provide caregivers with the opportunity to see each skill modeled before rehearsing it themselves. For example, in this final part, trainers pretended to be a disruptive child and research participants were taught to put the child (trainer) into time-out. In Session 3, trainers answered any remaining questions and asked participants to describe the rationale of all of the skills in an integrated way. The bulk of the session was then spent modeling and role-playing the nuances of skills. Skills were typically practiced with some increased challenges (e.g., time-out with a child refusing to go to time-out).MeasuresUser Satisfaction QuestionnaireSatisfaction with the web-based tutorial’s clinical content was evaluated using the USQ (Kobak, Reynolds, & Greist, 1994). The USQ is a self-report measure that contains eight statements pertaining to whether participants found the training to be interesting, easy to understand, enjoyable, useful/relevant, and satisfactory. Users rated their satisfaction on a 4-point scale (strongly agree, agree, disagree, strongly disagree). The scale ranges from 8 to 32 and has good internal consistency (Kobak, Lipsitz, Markowitz, & Bleiberg, 2017).System Usability ScaleSatisfaction with the technical aspects of the web-based tutorial was assessed with the 10-item SUS (Bangor, Kortum, & Miller, 2008; Brooke, 1996). The SUS is a reliable, well-validated measure designed to evaluate usability and user satisfaction with web-based applications and other technologies. On a 0 to 100 scale, a SUS score greater than 50.9 (mean rating for systems considered “okay”) is considered evidence of system user friendliness (Bangor, Kortum, & Miller, 2009; see Appendix B of the online supplemental materials for a copy of the SUS).Evaluation of user satisfaction with applied trainingThe EATS was used to evaluate satisfaction with the live coaching. It assessed trainees’ perspectives on how much they learned from the live training, their self-assessed competence on the various skills covered, and their level of satisfaction with live training components. The EATS has been used previously in studies of live online training (e.g., Kobak, Wolitzky-Taylor, Craske, & Rose, 2017; see Appendix C of the online supplemental materials for a copy of the EATS).Didactic knowledge questionnaireTo assess changes in participants’ knowledge of BPT concepts and principles (causes of noncompliance, operant conditioning, praise, play, commands, time-out), participants completed a 54-item, multiple-choice questionnaire created by the investigators before and after completing the online tutorial. Each item tests participants’ understanding of key critical concepts covered in the tutorial.BPT skill checklistTo assess change in skill at delivering BPT content, 13 videos were taken of each participant role-playing with trainers, both before they accessed the online tutorial and again after they had completed both the online tutorial and live coaching. Three videos were recorded for each of the four parenting skills (explaining the rationale for the skill to a parent, teaching a parent the steps involved in implementing the skill, demonstrating how to role-play the skill with a parent). The time-out skill included a fourth video on how to role-play handling noncompliance with time-out. Trainees’ pre- and posttraining videos were blindly evaluated using the BPT Skills Checklist (see Appendix D of the online supplemental materials for a copy of the checklist), which assessed the key points they were expected to address in each of the role-plays for each skill. Play included the largest number of key points (n = 29), followed by time-out (n = 27), praise (n = 24), and commands (n = 14).Adapted Fidelity of Implementation Rating SystemParticipants’ pre- and posttraining videos were also blindly rated using an abbreviated form of the FIMP (Knutson, Forgatch, Rains, & Sigmarsdóttir, 2009). The FIMP is a coding system that was created to measure therapists’ adherence to the Oregon model of parent management training (Forgatch, 1994) along five dimensions: Knowledge, Structure, Teaching, Process Skills, and Overall Development. Scores on the FIMP have been found to predict parent-training outcomes, such as improvement in children’s disruptive behavior (Thijssen, Albrecht, Muris, & de Ruiter, 2017). The FIMP is typically used to evaluate sections of BPT sessions that span 10 min or more. Given that the segments that were rated in the present study were much shorter (often 2 min or less) and were role-plays of specific skills, some of the items on the FIMP did not apply. For example, the original FIMP assesses how well practitioners explain homework assignments to clients, which did not apply in our case. We primarily used the knowledge and teaching subscales of the FIMP. Investigators rated each of the 13 pretraining and posttraining role-plays on a 9-point Likert scale. As on the original FIMP, scores between 1 and 3 were categorized as “needs work,” scores between 4 and 6 were categorized as “acceptable,” and scores between 7 and 9 were categorized as “good work.” The mean scores for each parenting skill were computed by adding the three FIMP ratings (rationale, teaching, and role-play) and dividing by three.ResultsSatisfactionSatisfaction with the clinical components of the online tutorial was assessed with the USQ. As shown in Table 2,TABLES AND FIGUREStable/figure thumbnailTable 2. User Satisfaction Questionnaire Mean Satisfaction Ratings of Online TutorialView larger image > in this page > in new window> Download slideon a scale from 1 to 4, with 1 signifying strongly disagree and 4 signifying strongly agree, overall, participants were satisfied with the online tutorial (M = 3.46, SD = .67) and would recommend it to others (M = 3.5, SD = .67). Participants found the online content interesting (M = 3.36, SD = .73), easy to understand (M = 3.73, SD = .46), enjoyable (M = 3.5, SD = .67), and useful/relevant in teaching them to help parents with noncompliant children (M = 3.68, SD = .48). Although still high, participants were less enthusiastic about their ability to apply these skills to clients (M = 3.23, SD = .43). This was expected, as the rating was made prior to live coaching and was one of the reasons for adding live coaching to the online content. Relating to the technical components of the online tutorial, participants rated the “system usability” score for the online tutorial as 86.7, which is between “excellent” and “best imaginable.”With respect to the live coaching, scores on the EATS indicated that overall satisfaction was high (M = 3.81, SD = .40). Trainees reported that the live coaching enhanced their professional expertise (M = 3.81, SD = .40) and facilitated answering their questions (M = 3.95, SD = 2.2). This rating was also on a scale from 1 to 4, with 1 signifying strongly disagree and 4 signifying strongly agree. Similarly, as shown in Table 3,TABLES AND FIGUREStable/figure thumbnailTable 3. Mean Ratings of Self-Assessed Competency on Behavioral Parent Training Skills Pre- and Posttraining (N = 21)View larger image > in this page > in new window> Download slidetrainees’ self-ratings of competence in using the four core BPT skills were low before training, ranging from 2.2 to 2.8 (on a scale from 1 = very little to 5 = a great deal), and high after training, ranging from 4.3 to 4.6. All four mean ratings were significantly higher at posttest than at pretest, with very large effect sizes.KnowledgeMean scores on the Didactic Knowledge Questionnaire evaluating trainee knowledge of the theory and practice of BPT at posttest (M = 40.36, SD = 4.93) were significantly higher than at pretest (M = 21.82, SD = 4.03; t = 18.24, p < .001). The effect size of the difference was very large (Cohen’s d = 3.889). As shown in Table 4,TABLES AND FIGUREStable/figure thumbnailTable 4. Mean Self-Ratings on the Evaluation of Applied Training ScaleView larger image > in this page > in new window> Download slideafter completing both training components, applicants rated their knowledge of the rationale for each of the four parenting skills and the practical steps for teaching each skill as very high, with mean scores for each rating reaching almost the top score of 5, which corresponded to “a great deal.”SkillUsing the BPT checklist, we rated participants’ skills on a series of structured role-plays at pretest and after participants had finished both online tutorial and remote coaching. Before training, out of 96 possible points, the average participant demonstrated 27.4 skills (SD = 14.2), and after training, the average score was 59.6 skills (SD = 12.6). The difference in means was statistically significant (t = 9.4, p < .001, Cohen’s d = 2.4). As shown in Table 5,TABLES AND FIGUREStable/figure thumbnailTable 5.

Similarly, as shown in Table 6,TABLES AND FIGUREStable/figure thumbnailTable 6. Mean Adapted Fidelity of Implementation Rating System (FIMP) Scale Scores, Pre- and Posttraining (N = 21)View larger image > in this page > in new window> Download slideblind continuous ratings of skill, using the adapted FIMP scale, revealed statistically significant improvements on observed skill in using all four BPT domains (all ps <.001), with very large effect sizes.Duration of TrainingThe mean number of days taken to complete the online tutorial was 27.04 (SD = 19.25, range = 2–66). The mean total duration of training (online tutorial plus remote coaching) was 69.57 days (SD = 23.70, range = 34–117).DiscussionThe purpose of this study was to develop a multicomponent, technology-based platform with the potential to train large numbers of mental health professionals in BPT. Findings suggest that the training platform increased trainees’ knowledge of BPT concepts and principles as well as improved BPT skills. Moreover, trainees reported high levels satisfaction with the online tutorial content as well as with the live remote coaching. Overall, the findings of this preliminary study are encouraging and indicate high potential for the BPT technology training platform to meet a significant limitation in the field, namely, limited access to engaging, efficient, and effective approaches to training mental health providers in BPT. The training platform initially provided an online tutorial, which allowed for self-paced acquisition of material, interactive self-tests with feedback, and video case vignettes of skill implementation. Following the online tutorial, trainees were provided live, remote coaching via videoconference. The coaching provided the essential opportunity to learn how to use the BPT skills through modeling and role-playing with feedback—essential to skill acquisition (Herschell et al., 2010). Evaluation of skill competencies is a critically overlooked aspect of continuing education programs. Use of web-based technologies can help facilitate this important aspect of training. Some have even suggested a competency-based system for awarding CE credits (Washburn et al., 2019).Results of the study demonstrated that following the training, participants self-reported high levels of understanding and competence in the concepts, principles, and techniques of BPT. It is important to note that trainees had low levels of self-reported competence at pretraining, with a relatively large standard deviation. It is likely that the large effects are driven by those trainees with initial low levels of initial competence. Importantly, self-reported increases in competence were paralleled by data demonstrating increases in observed skills. Specifically, on average, the number of steps of a BPT skill that was implemented correctly nearly doubled in all areas following training (see Table 5). Similarly, observed ratings of the quality of each skill implemented increased considerably from pretraining to posttraining (see Table 6). These observations of improved quantity and quality of BPT skills implemented suggested that this brief technology-based platform changes behavior in substantial ways—effect size data for the observed rating were large across all outcomes.Acceptability of a training approach is an important outcome, particularly when the training approach is to be disseminated to an audience with varying backgrounds (e.g., student trainees vs. licensed mental health providers; those with varying comfort with technology). As such, developing a user-friendly and highly acceptable training platform was a key goal of this study. Results of the study demonstrated that participants strongly agreed that the online tutorial was presented in a useful, relevant, and easy-to-understand manner. Moreover, participants rated that they were able to apply the skills and, overall, were satisfied with the tutorial. The data strongly suggest that this platform serves as a strong foundation for learning BPT specifically and CBT approaches more generally.The study had limitations that provide important context to better understand the findings and also point to future directions in this line of research and clinical training. First, this pilot study was an open trial with no control group or randomization to condition. This structure limits conclusions about causality, as it does not control for external threats to validity, such as regression to the mean, maturation, or history (Sapp, 2017). Another limitation is that study participants did not adequately represent the full range of mental health practitioners in the field. As an example, social work professionals are centrally involved in the delivery of interventions for children and families; however, only one participant in this study had a social work background. Moreover, the modal primary theoretical orientation of study participants was behavioral/cognitive–behavioral—individuals who are likely motivated to acquire further training on interventions, as this one did, that align with their particular orientation. The sample was also homogenous with respect to gender, ethnicity, and years of experience, potentially limiting the generalizability of findings to men, people of color, and more experienced clinicians. The online training was designed to cover fundamentals of social learning theory and BPT, which may be less useful for more advanced clinicians. However, the live supervision was conducted at the level of the trainee’s skill and often focused on advanced topics, such as implementation and flexibility for particular presentations.Beyond the representativeness of the sample, there were additional limitations. Most of the measures we used to assess outcomes were either adapted from other measures (e.g., the FIMP) or created by us. Although they have high face validity, measures with documented strong psychometric properties would inspire more confidence in the results. In addition, we did not assess BPT skills in the context of naturalistic therapy sessions with a parent. As such, our data are proxies for skills implementation and fidelity. Lastly, we did not assess longer term maintenance of BPT skills. Given that there is often a decrement in skills over time (Schoenwald, Garland, Southam-Gerow, Chorpita, & Chapman, 2011), the extent to which changes following training are maintained remains an unexplored issue.Despite the limitations of the study, the findings point to important clinical implications and future directions. First, findings suggest that the technology platform offers a user-friendly and effective approach to training both students and professionals in key, but limited, aspects of BPT. Importantly, relative to traditional, oft-used face-to-face training, the technology-focused training platform is efficient, while remaining effective in teaching concepts and skills. To our knowledge, there are no other technology-based training approaches to BPT—a surprising state of affairs given the common presentation of disruptive behavioral problems in clinic settings and the prominence of BPT as a first-line treatment approach. Given our findings, a fully developed, technology-based training platform offers an opportunity to bridge the research-to-practice gap through significantly increasing the availability of BPT by increasing the number of professionals trained in this intervention. In particular, incorporating this technology-based platform may be especially useful as part of formal training opportunities (e.g., continuing education courses, coursework in graduate school).Although useful, this technology-based platform requires further development to maximize its potential. In this regard, future development and research efforts must focus on incorporating other common BPT skills (e.g., active ignoring), understanding whether the live remote coaching results in incremental effects over the web-based tutorial, considering how best to further support individuals who respond differently to initial training efforts (e.g., adaptive, ongoing training), considering what additional approaches may be needed to ensure maintenance of training effects over time, and ensuring translation of clinical skills from analogue to actual naturalistic practice contexts. As a case in point, the four BPT skills were chosen because they are the foundation for which subsequent skills are administered (e.g., praise is an essential skill that underlies other skills, including shaping and planned attention). Future research examining whether there are particular skills that lend themselves to a hybrid or traditional face-to-face platform is a critical next step in order to move the field forward. This study suggests that this technology-based platform offers a strong foundation for training, which has the potential for significantly advancing the dissemination of a highly effective intervention for a ubiquitous childhood mental health challenge. In the United States, many of the states with the lowest percentage of licensed psychologists also have the highest number of people with mental illness (Hamp, Stamm, Christidis, & Nigrinis, 2014). Psychiatrists, psychologists, and social workers commonly establish their practice within higher-population, affluent, urban areas and larger cities with one or more major universities (Kazdin & Blase, 2011). On the other hand, across the United States, approximately 20% of the population, or 60 million people, live within rural areas (Stamm, 2003; U.S. Census Bureau, 2015). Even accessing mental health treatment within larger cities and affluent, urban areas can be difficult for many people dealing with mental health issues because of transportation issues (Collins, Westra, Dozois, & Burns, 2004). One potential ingredient to a more comprehensive solution to limited access to mental health treatment based on geography or transportation is telepsychology. A survey after a 3-month study using telepsychology for child assessments indicated that approximately 97% of parents appreciated eliminating the need to commute (Elford et al., 2001).The American Psychological Association (APA) defines telepsychology as the use of telecommunication technologies to provide psychological services (APA, 2015). This paper’s discussion of telepsychology is limited to the use of video-conferencing technology to deliver psychological services. This includes video-conferencing technology to connect participants in different medical centers, computer to home, and remote therapy utilizing smart phones. Telepsychology offers psychologists and clients a number of advantages over traditional, in-person modes of therapy. Individuals’ physical restrictions, limited time, or psychological symptoms can hinder their ability to attend sessions in person (Martin, 2013). Telepsychology can help psychologists begin to overcome these obstacles.Psychologists practicing within rural communities are more likely to encounter current and past clients during community activities, confront interconnected relationships within their own familial and social networks and those of their clients, and even face intersecting business interests (Schank & Skovholt, 1997). These overlapping roles can lead to a number of ethical dilemmas to navigate (Pope & Vasquez, 2011). Telepsychology can decrease the probability of these situations by granting psychologists the ability to extend their practice beyond geographical limitations (McCord et al., 2011). This can also result in a larger pool of potential clients rather than relying on members of the surrounding community (Centore & Milacci, 2008). Additionally, telepsychology could be used to connect individuals with psychologists who are fluent in their language or competent with their diagnosis or multicultural concerns (Hailey, Roine, & Ohinmaa, 2008; Yellowlees, Marks, Hilty, & Shore, 2008).Evidence also suggests that telepsychology adoption may result in lower costs across a variety of settings. A study comparing delivery methods for treating bulimia nervosa indicated that telepsychology was $2,024.28 cheaper per recovered client than in-person therapy (Crow et al., 2009). Studies on telepsychology adoption within correctional facilities show savings ranging from $12,000 to $1 million in savings (Deslich, Thistlethwaite, & Coustasse, 2013). Between 2006 and 2010, the U.S. Veteran’s Administration recorded a drop of approximately 25% in psychiatric admissions and length of hospitalization for telepsychology patients (Godleski, Darkins, & Peters, 2012).The question of telepsychology’s effectiveness has been examined since 1967, when it was first successfully used to connect mental health providers in Boston’s Massachusetts General Hospital in with patients nearly three miles away within Logan International Airport (Dwyer, 1973). Backhaus and colleagues (2012) conducted a thorough meta-analysis examining multiple aspects of telepsychology including randomized clinical trials (RCTs) comparing clinical outcome data between in-person therapy with telepsychology. Results suggested that outcomes in symptom reduction and levels of functioning were similar between telepsychology and in-person therapy when treating people for issues depression, anxiety, PTSD, or substance abuse. More recently, results of a similar 2018 meta-analysis of two-dozen RCT noninferiority studies indicated telepsychology is as effective as in-person therapy when treating individuals diagnosed with anxiety, depression, PTSD, and adjustment disorder (Varker, Brand, Ward, Terhaag, & Phelps, 2018).Telepsychology practitioners in the United States must comply with a complex set of state laws and federal requirements outlined within the Affordable Care Act, H.R. 4872 (2010) and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA). Furthermore, for psychologists specifically, there are a number of American Psychological Association (APA) requirements for telepsychology competency, ethical considerations, and data security (American Psychological Association, 2015). Although these additional requirements are reasonable and necessary considering the potential risks involved, they may contribute to psychologists’ decision to exclude telepsychology within their own practice.A common barrier to telepsychology that psychologists within the United States face is the possibility of practicing across state lines (Kramer, Kinn, & Mishkind, 2015). Although the APA acts as a nationwide accrediting body for education and training programs for psychologists (APA, 2016), individual states maintain control over enforcement and licensure requirements for individual psychologists to protect members of the public. When practicing across state lines, such permission is typically temporary (if granted), and therefore considering a long-term telepsychology practice often requires formal licensure in multiple states. Laws concerning the practice of psychology focus on the location of the client and not that of the psychologist (Kramer et al., 2015). As a result, the psychologist must meet interjurisdictional practice requirements within the state in which the client is currently located (APA, 2015; Association of State and Provincial Psychology Boards, 2016a). Some states may allow psychologists licensed out-of-state to practice under specific conditions for anywhere from 10 to 30 days within a calendar year (DeAngelis, 2012). California’s Board of Behavioral Sciences (BBS) released a bulletin warning consumers that when they travel, if they contact their psychologist for assistance using the Internet, a phone, or any electronic method, the psychologist must first verify that the state the client is in will permit them to provide therapy (California Board of Behavioral Sciences, 2016).Another issue facing psychologists interested in implementing telepsychology is using a network and video-conferencing platform that is HIPAA compliant. Although HIPAA’s Security Rules protect an individual’s electronic patient health information (ePHI), it does not apply to videoconferencing. However, HIPAA’s Privacy Rule does (U.S. Department of Health & Human Services, 2010). Among the HIPAA Privacy Rule’s requirements are access and audit control, breach notification, person or entity authentication, transmission security, workstation security, device and media controls, and a security management process (HIPAA). HIPAA does not certify the compliance of software, but companies willing to assume responsibility for collected data can claim HIPAA compliance.Skype, a popular and free video-conferencing software package, meets some HIPAA requirements such as entity authentication and robust encryption by current standards to facilitate transmission security (APA, 2014). Where Skype falls short is audit control, meaning its inability to monitor accesses to ePHI. Skype also lacks breach notification to let administrators know when unauthorized users access ePHI (APA, 2014). As with HIPAA compliance, the robust requirements surrounding data encryption and security can be a daunting task (APA, 2015). Experts in computer security and cryptography have argued that it is not possible to develop tamper-proof computer systems, only tamper-evident ones (Schneier, 2011). Considering how little direct control psychologists maintain once they transmit data outside the walls of their practice, fears of data theft may be another source of reservation against use of telepsychology. There are services such as BetterHelp, Regain, TalkSpace, and Breakthrough that advertise HIPAA compliance, and may include confidentiality agreements, robust data encryption, and liability insurance imbedded within the package. Standards continue to evolve in terms of coverage that are enabling increasing opportunities for practice and the market attempting to overcome barriers. Along those lines, Maheu et al. (2017) point out (and are attempting to address) the substantial need for tools to assist clinicians as they sort through available technologies and objectively determine which ones are clinically appropriate for their practice.Psychologists using telepsychology expecting financial reimbursement from health insurance companies or publicly funded health care programs must first verify for each client if, and under what conditions, the third party will reimburse them for their services. Although Medicare does not specify where a psychologist has to be located (e.g., health clinic, independent practice, at home), it will not cover telehealth interventions unless the client receives treatment within a doctor’s office, hospital, authorized health care center, or nursing facility (Medicare, 2016). Blue Cross and Blue Shield, an association of health care insurance providers insuring more than 106 million individuals (Blue Cross and Blue Shield, 2016a), will reimburse for telepsychology if the psychologist is part of specific online care providers network (Blue Cross and Blue Shield, 2015, 2016b).A number of states have passed legislation requiring private insurance companies to cover policyholders seeking telepsychology treatment. Arizona’s Telemedicine Reimbursement Parity Act (2013) requires private insurers to cover individuals receiving health services (including mental health) via video conferencing if they live in counties with populations under 900,000 or people who live more than 30 miles from the nearest city. The California Insurance Code (2011) prohibits private insurers from requiring individuals meet in-person with health care providers, or from dictating the type of setting they meet within. Meanwhile, a number of states including Florida, Idaho, Kansas, Nebraska, Nevada, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and North Carolina do not have laws mandating private insurers cover telepsychology.Although no research to date has looked at personal or environmental characteristics of psychologists as predictors of telepsychology adoption (or any health care provider group for that matter with telehealth), a potential guide may be found in research investigating adoption of evidence-based practices (EBPs) examining individual and setting characteristics as potential factors in the adoption of new practice approaches. This is not to conflate EBPs and telepsychology, as telepsychology may be a modality for implementing EBPs, but it is itself not an EBP. These factors include individual characteristics such as older age, female sex, White race/ethnicity, fewer years of experience (Aarons et al., 2010), treatment setting, treatment focus, and organizational culture (Aarons, 2004).Results from a study of 322 clinical service workers representing 51 different mental health programs for children, adolescents, and their families indicate adoption of EBPs depends on organizational qualities and individual attributes (Aarons, 2004). Higher positive attitudes toward adopting EBPs were seen in intern-level practitioners rather than more senior practitioners, and those with higher levels of education. Understandably, organizational culture and mission are also contexts for change. When required to adopt EBPs by the organization, providers working in day-treatment programs had more positive attitudes toward adoption of EBPs than practitioners working in outpatient programs. Providers also reported more positive attitudes toward EBPs when working within organizations with lower levels of bureaucracy, wraparound programs, and programs with written practice policies (Aarons, 2004).Perle, Burt, and Higgins (2014) examined psychologists’ self-reported attitudes toward telepsychology. Close to 80% indicated they viewed telepsychology interventions as effective, but 42% viewed telepsychology less effective than in-person therapy. Almost 75% of the sample also indicated they were not likely to refer someone for telepsychology services. Results revealed that scarcity of referral sources, privacy issues, legal concerns, client safety, perceived lack of research, reimbursement concerns, and insufficient training resulted in hesitation to adopt telepsychology. Additionally, early career psychologists (practicing 10 years or less) report higher levels of concern about insufficient training with telehealth (Glueckauf et al., 2018). Topics emphasized among those interested in further training were ethical and legal issues, efficacy data including research comparing telepsychology with traditional modalities, safety/crisis information, reimbursement procedures, system costs, and training in setting up a telepsychology practice (Perle et al., 2014).The purpose of the current study is to identify significant demographic, organizational, and clinical factors of psychologists’ use of telepsychology within their practice. Based on previous literature examining the adoption of new practice approaches (Aarons, 2004; Aarons et al., 2010; Perle et al., 2014), it is hypothesized that the following variables will predict greater intention to use telepsychology: older age, female gender, White race/ethnicity, fewer years of experience, a more highly structured treatment setting, rural location of practice, the existence of organizational policies concerning telepsychology, and previous training in the use of telepsychology. The selection of these factors was guided by their potential for informing future interventions aiding telepsychology adoption at both the individual and organizational levels.MethodParticipantsTo participate, individuals had to (a) be aged 18 or older, (b) possess a doctorate, (c) be a licensed psychologist, and (d) be currently practicing psychotherapy. A database of potential participants was generated using psychology newsgroups, membership rosters from professional organizations, and counseling center mental health facility websites. These sources were selected because they allowed outside research invitations and provided a large enough pool of potential participants for adequate analysis. Data were collected from July 6th, 2017 until July 26th, 2017 and resulted in 1,799 completed surveys. Eight surveys were discarded because participants provided implausible answers to both their age and years in practice, or they entered nonsense answers to a significant portion of the survey or the validity check question (“In one sentence or less, what do you think the purpose of this study was?”). This yielded a total of 1,791 complete and valid surveys (see Table 1).TABLES AND FIGUREStable/figure thumbnailTable 1. Summary of Participant CharacteristicsView larger image > in this page > in new window> Download slideSample demographics on age, gender, and race/ethnicity are similar to provider statistics within a 2015 APA report (Stamm, Lin, & Christidis, 2017). The sample also had representation from all 50 states, as well as each treatment focus and approach proposed within the survey.MeasuresParticipants were asked to provide demographic data about themselves (age, gender, race/ethnicity, years in practice), and information about their practice including their practice location (urban, suburban, rural), training and current use of telepsychology (yes or no), and whether policies permitting telepsychology exist within their organization. Participants were asked, “What is your theoretical therapeutic approach (select all that apply)?” and “What is the treatment focus of your primary mental health services setting (select all that apply)?” Most of these items were simple demographic items commonly used in psychology research studies, and no formal scales had been developed to date assessing the constructs in any more comprehensive way. As a result, all items were researcher-generated and informed by foci of previous studies. Because all items are standalone, no indices of internal reliability are applicable.ProcedurePotential participants received an e-mail invitation to participate in a 10-min study that “examines the feasibility of different treatment approaches in mental health practice.” No reference to telepsychology was made in the recruitment e-mail in an effort to not select for psychologists who were highly interested in telepsychology. Participants who followed the HTML link in the e-mail were presented with an institutional review board-approved informed consent document, to which they had to agree to participate. Then, participants were presented with a screener section of the Qualtrics web platform and had to respond affirmatively to the following questions to be allowed to participate: (a) Are you licensed to practice as a psychologist in the United States?; (b) Are you currently practicing psychotherapy?; and (c) Are you at least 18 years of age? Participants then completed a number of questions about themselves and their practice. They read the following: “For the purpose of this survey, ‘telepsychology’ refers the use of video conferencing technology to provide psychotherapy.” They then answered questions about their use of telepsychology.Data AnalysisThree logistic regressions were run to examine potential statistical predictors of current telepsychology use. The first included the following predictors: age, gender, race/ethnicity, existence of organizational policies supporting telepsychology, prior training in the use of telepsychology, and geographic location of practice. The second including the following dummy-coded (0 vs. 1) primary practice setting predictors: Correctional facility, geriatric facility, academic medical center, VA, individual/group practice, residential treatment facility, and school/university. The third included a number of dummy-coded treatment foci of participants’ primary practice setting. These analyses were conducted using SPSS Version 24.0 (Arbuckle, 2016). Significance was established at an alpha level of .05, two-tailed.ResultsLogistic Regression 1A logistic regression was used to model the binary variable of current use of telepsychology (with not currently using as the reference category) and with binary statistical predictor variables of gender (woman vs. other), race/ethnicity (White/European American vs. minority), rural location or not, the existence of organizational policies supporting telepsychology, whether participants have received training in the use of telepsychology, and the quantitative predictor variable of age (years of clinical practice was fully multicollinear, so age was chosen instead). The model provided a statistically significant prediction of current use of telepsychology, χ2(6) = 383.81, p < .001. The Nagelkerke pseudo R2 indicated the model accounted for 29.8% of the total variance.When controlling for the other factors, the likelihood of participants using telepsychology was approximately 8.74 times higher for psychologists practicing in organizations where policies supporting telepsychology exist (p < .001) than those practicing within organizations without supporting policies. Also, psychologists who had received training in telepsychology were 2.25 times more likely (p < .001) to use telepsychology than those who had not. The likelihood was .46 times lower for psychologists practicing in rural areas (p = .002) versus nonrural practitioners. No other factors exerted a unique effect on current use of telepsychology (see Table 2).TABLES AND FIGUREStable/figure thumbnailTable 2. Variables in Logistic Regression 1View larger image > in this page > in new window> Download slideLogistic Regression 2A second logistic regression was used to model the binary variable of current use of telepsychology using binary predictor variables reflecting the setting participants practice within. Although all participants were included in the analysis, practice setting categories that were endorsed by 15 or fewer participants, irrespective of the size of their practice, were not given their own dummy code which resulted in excluding specific comparisons for psychologists practicing in a career center, employee assistance program, or religious organization. The model provided a statistically significant prediction of current use of telepsychology, χ2(7) = 63.015, p < .001. The Nagelkerke pseudo R2 indicated the model accounted for 5.3% of the total variance.When controlling for the other factors, the likelihood of participants using telepsychology was 3.37 times higher for psychologists practicing in Veterans Affairs Medical Centers (p = .001) than non-VA psychologists. Psychologists practicing in individual or group practice were 2.86 times higher for (p < .001), than psychologists working within public or institutional settings such as hospitals, schools, and geriatric facilities. No other predictors exerted a unique effect on current use of telepsychology (see Table 3).TABLES AND FIGUREStable/figure thumbnailTable 3.

The model provided a statistically significant prediction of current use of telepsychology, χ2(54) = 158.172, p < .001. The Nagelkerke pseudo R2 indicated the model accounted for 13.1% of the total variance.When controlling for the other factors, the likelihood of participants using telepsychology was approximately 1.86 times higher for psychologists focusing on sports performance (p = .020), 1.83 times higher for life coaching (p = .002), 1.70 times higher for treating narcissistic personality (p = .008), 1.60 times higher for treating addiction (p = .004), 1.47 times higher for marital and premarital counseling (p = .011), 1.42 times higher for focusing on parenting (p = .040), and 1.42 times higher for treating eating disorders (p = .049). The likelihood was .69 times lower for psychologists providing testing and evaluation (p = .024), .67 times lower when treating grief (p = .012), .64 times lower with treating bipolar disorder (p = .006), .64 times lower when focused on treatment compliance/medication management (p = .028), .60 times lower when treating obesity (p = .022), .50 times lower when treating antisocial personality (p = .024), and .47 times lower for psychologists focused on racial identity (p = .009) when compared with psychologists who did not identify with each category. No other factors exerted a unique effect on current use of telepsychology (see Table 4).TABLES AND FIGUREStable/figure thumbnailTable 4. Variables in Logistic Regression 3View larger image > in this page > in new window> Download slideDiscussionFor the purpose of this paper and this discussion, the use of the term telepsychology refers the use of video conferencing technology to provide psychotherapy. Telepsychology has the ability to help psychologists assist individuals who, for a number of reasons, may have reduced ability to attend traditional in-person therapy. The purpose of this study was to examine factors that statistically predict psychologists’ decision to use telepsychology in their own practice. Generally, results revealed psychologists are more likely to use telepsychology if there are telepsychology-supportive organizational policies in their place of practice and if they believe they were adequately trained to use telepsychology. This finding is similar to previous research literature in which mental health providers reported more favorable attitudes toward adopting new EBPs when their organization has written policies in place (Aarons, 2004). This also aligns with previous research indicating that two thirds of psychological professionals, especially early career practitioners, perceived they did not possess sufficient training to work with their clients using telepsychology (Glueckauf et al., 2018; Perle et al., 2014).There was a higher likelihood of using telepsychology among psychologists who provided life coaching and those who treated individuals with narcissistic personalities. It is possible that the percentages for coaching and performance consulting were higher because those activities may encounter fewer regulations than others. Also, psychologists within U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Medical Centers or practicing in an individual/group practice were more likely to use telepsychology. The VA results are not surprising when the importance of policies and training on use of telepsychology are considered. The VA has implemented a very robust, multistage training program to teach practitioners how to initiate and conduct telepsychology and telehealth interventions. They have also established a number of policies concerning the use of telepsychology and continue to address current interjurisdictional barriers blocking VA practitioners from using telepsychology to treat veterans across state lines when veterans are not within a VA facility (Authority of Health Care Providers to Practice Telehealth, 2017). Their continued endorsement of this mode of treatment is evident in the more than 2 million telehealth sessions used during the fiscal year of 2016 to assist veterans within their care, and their rollout of VA Video Connect system allowing veterans to participate in telehealth sessions using their own computers and smartphones (U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, 2017). Conversely, the increased use of telepsychology among psychologists in individual/group practice may be the result of working within a low-bureaucracy environment where psychologists themselves can make their own decisions about telepsychology clinical practice. With that said, the level of reported favorability was not as high as VA psychologists which may reflect a slight fear of sanctions as a potential limiting influence.Results also indicated higher likelihood of telepsychology use among psychologists who provided marital/premarital counseling, or parenting support. These results align with a study by Aarons (2004) indicating that practitioners within wraparound programs for children and families were more likely to adopt new EBPs. Also, parents receiving counseling via telepsychology rated their satisfaction with the experience very highly, in part because it was easier to fit sessions into their schedules by avoiding commute times (Elford et al., 2001).On the other hand, psychologists were less likely to use telepsychology if they practiced within a rural area. This result was unexpected considering telepsychology could allow practitioners in rural areas to reach a greater number of individuals while decreasing the chances of dual relationships (Centore & Milacci, 2008; McCord et al., 2011). It may be the case that rural practitioners judge their resources are too limited to acquire and support a telepsychology platform, although future research on this topic is required.Psychologists focused on treatment compliance/medication management, bipolar disorder, obesity, grief, and antisocial personality were less likely to use telepsychology. Perhaps those who were treating more acutely ill clients were not using telepsychology because they felt doing so entailed unnecessary and increased risk. Psychologists who provided testing and evaluation were also less likely to use telepsychology. Although some common assessments have been validated and normed using telepsychology, many require adapting the assessment or finding an alternative assessment if adaptation cannot be accomplished (Luxton, Pruitt, & Osenbach, 2014). Also, while performing a battery of assessments, it is common practice to incorporate relevant interpersonal interactions into the final assessment. Psychologists working in this area may perceive they can achieve a more comprehensive assessment in-person. It may be that they work within institutions or locations that more easily facilitate in-person interactions.The current findings suggest that identifying as a woman was not a significant statistical predictor of telepsychology use. This is in contrast with the results of a study indicating that women who provide mental health services were more likely to adopt EBPs when compared with men (Aarons et al., 2010). These results do agree with results from an earlier study demonstrating women were no more open to adopting EBPs than men were (Aarons, 2004).Age was also not found to be a significant statistical predictor of telepsychology use. Preliminary analysis revealed age and experience were highly correlated with one another, so because of this, only age was tested as a predictor. The multicollinearity of the two variables means experience would have yielded a similar result. This was unexpected in consideration of previous literature indicating older individuals and individuals early in their careers were more open to new EBPs (Aarons, 2004; Aarons et al., 2010). However, it does undermine the stereotype that older individuals are less likely to adopt new technologies.ImplicationsThe results suggest a number of implications. Organizations interested in implementing telepsychology may benefit from creating policies supporting its use and provide adequate training, as these were the two biggest statistical predictors of use. For example, the VA has developed very specific policies surrounding the use of telepsychology (U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, 2017), which might account for the substantial increased use of telepsychology found in the current study among psychologists working in the VA.For government and regulatory entities, creating clear, specific, and consistent laws governing the use of telepsychology could potentially encourage more psychologists to treat individuals currently restricted from mental health services by time or geography. States with too few mental health professionals might make telepsychology more useful and easier to use by easing current rules concerning interjurisdictional practice. The Association of State and Provincial Psychology Boards (ASPPB) is already moving in this direction and has developed Psychology Interjurisdictional Compact (PSYPACT), intended to facilitate telepsychology across state lines (Association of State and Provincial Psychology, 2016b). States that enact PSYPACT into law would allow psychologists to conduct telepsychology with clients located within other PSYPACT states without holding a license in the client’s state. Currently, only eight states have enacted PSYPACT legislation at the time of this writing. The findings from this study could potentially support the passage of such legislation as a way to increase psychologists’ adoption of telepsychology. Additionally, legislation requiring insurance companies to reimburse for telepsychology sessions may increase psychologists’ perceptions concerning telepsychology’s ease of use and usefulness for themselves and their clients. Currently, there are 30 states that have passed such laws with another seven with proposed legislation under consideration (American Telemedicine Association, 2017).Limitations and Future DirectionsThe current study possesses a number of limitations and as a result offers directions for future research. Internet-based surveys can lead to bias because the researcher has no control over who chooses to participate (Anderson & Kanuka, 2003; Leary, 2012). This form of sampling may have led to a participant sample possessing a higher level of acceptance of technology than a more comprehensive but costly sampling method. Despite this limitation, the geographic diversity across all 50 U.S. states was only achievable using an Internet-based approach. A large proportion (65.5%) of participants indicated they worked within independent practice, whereas the APA reports this sample characteristic should be closer to 44.7% (Stamm et al., 2017). As a result, conclusions based on these findings may not be fully reflective of the population of practicing psychologists in the United States and should be made with caution. The results contained a mix of large-, medium-, and small-sized effects. The large sample size allowed the analyses to pick up on even small-sized effects, though the implications of these findings should be tempered accordingly when considering small-sized effects. Also, considering the large number of analyses, there is an increased likelihood that some results, especially the results with smaller p values, are a result of chance. Consequently, caution should be maintained when interpreting these results.Another weakness in the current study is that participants were not asked to specify if they were primarily connecting to clients at home, a clinic, or somewhere else. Also, participants were not asked how much telepsychology is a part of their overall practice. Doing so would have provided a more comprehensive and nuanced picture of how telepsychology is being implemented. For example, a number of neuropsychology assessments are not appropriate, or have not yet been fully adapted, for use via telepsychology. Data concerning what aspects of telepsychology are working well, what forms of telepsychology need work, and what activities of treatment or assessment currently disqualify telepsychology as a viable option could provide a more complete exploration of psychologists’ perceptions and experiences about telepsychology. Additionally, demographic predictors such as gender, socioeconomic status, and race/ethnicity of clients were not examined to determine whether some populations vary in their receptivity or responsiveness to telepsychology. Future research in this direction may reveal additional considerations for psychologists when contemplating telepsychology’s place within their practice. Another potential area for further research is to understand why rural psychologists reported a lower likelihood of adopting telepsychology compared with nonrural ones, despite the benefits of a larger pool of prospective clients across the state(s) in which they are licensed, and the improved access to mental health services for rural populations.Finally, the current study did not seek to determine what barriers to adoption exist for psychologists across a variety of treatment emphases. It is also important to examine current challenges to telepsychology’s overall effectiveness. Asking these questions in future research could elucidate what features are required to facilitate different interventions, and indicate which ones are not currently adaptable and where psychologists perceive current methods and technologies fall short of what is needed to engender lasting and substantive support for demonstrably effective interventions using the technology.ConclusionsPsychologists were more likely to engage in telepsychology if they had received specific training in it, or practice in a setting with policies supporting the use of telepsychology. Psychologists with particular treatment emphases, working within the VA, and to a lesser degree, psychologists in a group or individual practice were more likely to use telepsychology. On the other hand, psychologists within rural areas or some treatment emphases were less likely to use it. Organizations, training institutions, application developers, private organizations, and public institutions can all play a part in shaping current and future psychologists’ perceptions concerning the use of telepsychology. Doing so could benefit a number of regions in the United States by increasing access to mental health services for people who are currently facing no treatment options. IntroductionTraumatic brain injury (TBI) represents the leading cause of death and disability in childhood. More than 600,000 children and adolescents are seen in emergency departments across the United States each year as a result of TBI, and early childhood and adolescence represents two peaks in TBI incidence across the life span (Taylor, Bell, Breiding, & Xu, 2017). Children and adolescents who have sustained a moderate to severe TBI are at risk of developing a range of psychological and physical health issues, including attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, depression, learning disorders, and speech/language difficulties (Albicini & McKinlay, 2015; Bloom et al., 2001; Haarbauer-Krupa et al., 2018; Li & Liu, 2013; Max et al., 1997, 1998; Schwartz et al., 2003). Although children and adolescents with a moderate to severe TBI represent a pediatric population with heightened need for psychological services, many of their behavioral health needs are unmet (Karver et al., 2014). This is likely attributable in part to difficulties accessing specialized services or traditional in-office care resulting from injury-related barriers such as fatigue and motor problems, as well as general barriers to help-seeking such as living in rural areas (Ronzio, Guagliardo, & Persaud, 2006), lack of transportation, and lack of time.In recent years, the advent of inexpensive videoconferencing programs, integrated web or phone cameras, and ever-expanding Internet access have made the possibility of delivering physical and behavioral health interventions via web-based platforms increasingly feasible and cost-effective. Indeed, telepsychology, that is, the “provision of psychological services using telecommunication technologies,” such as with mobile devices, text messaging, and e-mail is a growing field (American Psychology Association, Joint Task Force for the Development of Telepsychology Guidelines for Psychologists, 2013). Telepsychology, and the broader use of telehealth to deliver both physical and behavioral health interventions, increases accessibility to care for a wide range of populations. For example, videoconferencing software enables families living in rural areas to engage in synchronous communication with a psychologist, without having to travel long distances to a primary care facility.Telepsychology may be uniquely suited to the needs of children and families impacted by a range of pediatric concerns requiring rehabilitation care, including TBI. This is because children and families can access interventions from their home, and do not have to concern themselves with arranging child-care, or traveling with a child who may have health concerns, physical disabilities, and/or severe emotional or behavioral challenges. Although telepsychology may increase accessibility, telepsychology interventions with children and families impacted by pediatric conditions may pose unique difficulties such as challenges associated with the child’s developmental level, motor issues, behavioral challenges, as well as difficulties engaging multiple participants (i.e., parent/s and their children) without the psychologist being physically present (Slone, Reese, & McClellan, 2012). Moreover, conditions that impair attention and executive function skills (e.g., attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and cognitive impairment attributable to TBI) may render telehealth approaches less effective than face-to-face treatment. Nonetheless, telehealth and telepsychology interventions have been increasingly used with a variety of pediatric populations such as children with traumatic brain injury, chronic pain, obesity, cancer, and encopresis (e.g., Davis, Sampilo, Gallagher, Landrum, & Malone, 2013; Palermo, Wilson, Peters, Lewandowski, & Somhegyi, 2009; Richardson, Frueh, Grubaugh, Egede, & Elhai, 2009; Ritterband et al., 2008; Van Allen, Davis, & Lassen, 2011; Wade et al., 2015).Recognizing both the need for services and the barriers to care, Wade and colleagues have spent the past 15 years developing and testing web-based interventions for children/families impacted by pediatric TBI. The interventions and data regarding their efficacy are described in greater detail elsewhere (Antonini et al., 2014; Antonini, Raj, Oberjohn, & Wade, 2012; Wade et al., 2014; Wade et al., 2015; Wade, Walz, Carey, & Williams, 2008). In brief, these web-based interventions were delivered to children and adolescents with moderate to severe TBI and at least one of their caregivers. The intervention for younger children (ages 3 to 9 years), Internet-Interacting Together Everyday (I-InTERACT), was a positive parenting skills intervention in which parents learned positive parenting skills via web content and also received live coaching of these skills during weekly videoconference sessions with a clinician. The interventions for adolescents and their caregiver/s, Counselor Assisted Problem Solving (CAPS) and Teen Online Problem Solving (TOPS), provided training in problem-solving skills, self-regulation, and communication (Nezu & D’zurilla, 2006). Similar to I-InTERACT, families accessed information via web-content before weekly meetings with a clinician via synchronous videoconferencing to discuss, practice, and role-play skills. To bridge the digital divide and enable all families to participate (Calvert, Rideout, Woolard, Barr, & Strouse, 2005), families without existing home computers were provided with computers and web cameras, and all participants were reimbursed for high-speed Internet access for 6 months. Data collected since 2002 from families involved in these studies support the feasibility, acceptability, and efficacy of a telehealth treatment approach for children and families impacted by pediatric TBI (Antonini et al., 2012, 2014; Narad et al., 2015; Raj et al., 2015; Wade et al., 2008, 2012, 2014, 2015).In additional studies with children and families impacted by pediatric TBI, there has been research supporting the efficacy of telepsychology interventions in improving child behavioral outcomes and supporting caregiver functioning in other pediatric populations (e.g., Palermo et al., 2009; Richardson et al., 2009; Slone et al., 2012; Van Allen, Davis, & Lassen, 2011). However, although the evidence base for telepsychology is increasing, little is known about clinician perceptions and experiences delivering telepsychology. One exception is a review of telemedicine in pediatric psychology by Van Allen and colleagues (2011), which included a summary of how telepsychology was delivered at a single site and anecdotal descriptions of clinician experiences and satisfaction. Clinicians at this site reported high satisfaction delivering telepsychology, though they also reported that very young children did not respond as well and that therapies which required a high level of interaction, such as play therapy, were less feasible via telehealth (Van Allen et al., 2011). More rigorous research with multiple sites is needed to gain a more cohesive understanding of clinician experiences and satisfaction delivering telepsychology.Clinician perceptions delivering telepsychology are also important because this feedback can help determine profiles of children/families who may be more likely to benefit from one intervention modality over another (e.g., a better fit with an in-office intervention vs. telepsychology). In addition, clinician perspectives regarding advantages and challenges can inform intervention delivery and serve to improve both client and clinician satisfaction. Finally, feedback from clinicians who have delivered in-office and web-based interventions can help determine qualities of clinicians who may find one modality more effective and satisfying than the other. The broad aim of this study was to explore and describe clinician experiences delivering telehealth interventions to children/families impacted by pediatric TBI as part of a number of research studies. Satisfaction data from families who participated in these studies have been largely positive, with parents reporting high levels of satisfaction with the intervention and online delivery format (Antonini et al., 2012; Wade, Walz, Carey, & Williams, 2009; Wade, Wolfe, & Pestian, 2004). However, little is known about clinician experiences and perceptions of advantages and disadvantages of using telehealth over the traditional in-office, face-to-face treatment format. To broaden stakeholder input, we invited all clinicians who had delivered online therapies for pediatric TBI in past and present interventions to participate in this study. In addition to clinician experiences, we were interested in gaining clinician perceptions of advantages and limitations of telepsychology treatments for children and families impacted by pediatric TBI. We also sought to understand clinician perspectives on the family and clinician factors that supported the utility and efficacy of telepsychology for pediatric TBI. We expected clinicians to report online delivery to be similar to face-to-face on most dimensions examined, with some areas where online delivery is favorable and others where face-to-face delivery is preferable.MethodParticipantsClinicians, including licensed psychologists, psychology fellows, and advanced doctoral students, who delivered telepsychology interventions to children/adolescents and families impacted by pediatric TBI as part of a series of eight clinical trials were invited to participate. These trials took place between 2002 and 2017, and were conducted at six large tertiary care hospitals in Colorado, Minnesota, and Ohio. Demographic characteristics of these families varied widely by parental education, income, and urban versus rural place of residence (Antonini et al., 2014; Wade et al., 2017, 2018). Six of these trials involved family centered cognitive–behavioral therapy with the child, ages 11–19, one or both parents, and siblings when possible. Sessions focused on helping the child and family to cope more effectively with the challenges they were facing. In these studies, time since injury ranged from 0–24 months. Two trials involved parent skills training with live coaching and included the child ages 3–9, and one or both parents. This treatment focused on the parent’s interaction with the child. For both treatments, sessions were held weekly to biweekly for a period of four to six months. All but three of the therapists delivered both treatments. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the primary hospital where the intervention studies were based. The interventions were delivered using varying videoconferencing platforms over the years, including Polycom Viavideo, Skype, Movi, and Facetime, and most sessions conducted after 2006 were delivered via Skype.All previous and current clinicians (n = 17) were invited to participate. Of those, three either failed to respond to the request or were unable to be contacted, resulting in a participation rate of 76% (n = 13) for the surveys and 82% (n = 14) for the focus groups/key-informant interviews (one clinician who participated in the key-informant interview did not complete a survey). At the time of treatment delivery, six of the clinicians were licensed psychologists, one was an unlicensed psychology postdoctoral fellow, and seven were advanced clinical psychology graduate students. At the time of the present study, 10 were licensed psychologists and four were unlicensed postdoctoral fellows in clinical psychology. When the surveys and interviews were conducted, six clinicians were actively delivering both face-to-face and telehealth interventions to adolescents with TBI, and time since delivery of the treatment protocol and the present study for the remaining clinicians ranged from 1 to 5 years. A few clinicians (n = 2) had previously delivered phone-based interventions, but most clinicians had not delivered telepsychology interventions before working on these clinical trials. Clinicians who participated in this study delivered the telepsychology interventions described above to between 14 and upward of 50 children/adolescents and families. All but one clinician were female.MeasuresTelepsychology surveyParticipants completed a survey comparing telepsychology (delivered via synchronous videoconferencing) to face-to-face therapy on 16 dimensions commonly addressed in psychotherapy research (e.g., therapeutic alliance, reading nonverbal cues, family motivation, clinician engagement, etc.; see Table 1TABLES AND FIGUREStable/figure thumbnailTable 1. Clinician Ratings of Telepsychology Versus Face-to-Face TreatmentsView larger image > in this page > in new window> Download slidefor a complete list). The survey was developed by the research team to capture a range of factors salient to the delivery and experiences of clinicians providing psychotherapy to children/adolescents and families. Participants were asked to rate each item on a 5-point scale with the options ranging from 1 = face-to-face much better than online; 2 = face-to-face somewhat better than online; 3 = face-to-face and online about the same; 4 = online somewhat better than face-to-face; to 5 = online much better than face-to-face. To facilitate interpretation, responses were collapsed into the following three categories: (a) face-to-face better than online (survey score of 1 or 2); (b) face-to-face equivalent to online (survey score of 3); and (c) online better than face-to-face (survey score of 4 or 5). In addition to ratings, each item was followed by a space for comments where participants were encouraged to qualify their responses. This open-ended feedback was analyzed together with the focus group and key-informant interview data described below.Focus group/interviewsIn addition to completing surveys, clinicians were invited to participate in one of two focus groups, and those who were unable to attend either of the focus groups completed a key informant interview covering similar content. The aims of the focus groups/interviews were to gain a richer understanding of clinician experiences and to provide context and detail to survey responses. The research team developed a semistructured interview protocol for the focus groups/interviews which included open-ended questions and prompts (e.g., “Describe your experience delivering telepsychology interventions”; “What are the advantages/disadvantages you perceive between delivering behavioral health interventions via telepsychology vs. face-to-face?”; and “Think about families you have worked with, identify qualities of families that you feel are poised to benefit more from web-based interventions over face-to-face sessions, and vice versa”). Nine clinicians participated in the focus groups (five in the first, four in the second), and the remaining five clinicians completed key informant interviews using the same semistructured protocol as the focus groups. All focus groups and interviews were led by a licensed clinical psychologist who was also the primary supervisor on the research studies. In addition, two postdoctoral fellows in clinical psychology helped facilitate the focus groups. Handwritten notes were made by the facilitator and both postdoctoral fellows during the focus groups and the facilitator took notes during the one-on-one interviews. Efforts were made to transcribe responses verbatim.AnalysesThis mixed-methods study utilized a sequential explanatory design (Creswell, 2013), whereby data collection and analyses were conducted in two stages. In the first stage, descriptive statistics were used to analyze the quantitative results from the surveys. In the second stage, qualitative data were gathered to qualify quantitative data and to provide a richer understanding of responses and findings. Qualitative data were examined using qualitative content analysis, which is a widely used approach in social science research (Zhang & Wildemuth, 2009). Given that the aim of the qualitative data was to expand and explain quantitate findings, a directed content analysis approach was used (Hsieh & Shannon, 2005). Consistent with this approach, the focus group/interview protocol included broad open-ended questions, as well as targeted questions that were guided by the quantitative responses of informants.Qualitative data analysis began with the research team reviewing open-ended responses to the surveys and reading notes from the focus groups/informant interviews. Responses were coded during group meetings by the team as a whole using some predetermined codes (e.g., ease of scheduling, technical difficulties), and new codes that emerged were duly added to relevant categories/clusters. Efforts to enhance trustworthiness of findings included regular “on the spot” member checks during interviews (i.e., clarifying what participants said). In addition, analysis was conducted by the entire team of researchers, all of whom have familiarity with telepsychology interventions. This team approach, and reliance on group consensus, helped minimize the effects of individual bias and preferences. When there were discrepant opinions about codes/themes, the researchers discussed and negotiated until they reached agreement. The high response rate helped minimize bias and provided the opportunity for a range of responses, as respondents included those who delivered telepsychology interventions when these interventions were still novel (i.e., more than 10 years ago) and those currently delivering telepsychology. Finally, details of the participants and the telepsychology interventions are provided throughout the results to give context to the findings and to aid readers in determining how transferable and generalizable findings are to other telepsychology interventions.ResultsWe begin by presenting results from the surveys (also see Table 1); specifically, a count of clinicians who rated a survey item as being either better, similar, or worse between telepsychology and face-to-face interventions. We then elaborate on these findings with qualitative responses in the interviews. We also summarize additional themes that emerged from the focus groups/interviews (see Table 2).TABLES AND FIGUREStable/figure thumbnailTable 2. Qualitative Feedback on Advantages and Disadvantages of Telepsychology Interventions and Characteristics of Families Likely to Benefit From Telepsychology Versus Face-to-Face TreatmentView larger image > in this page > in new window> Download slideContent reported in quotes represents verbatim responses from one or more participants.Dimensions Where Telepsychology Is Favorable to Face-to-Face InterventionThe greatest advantage of online delivery versus face-to-face reported was an increased understanding of the home environment (85% of respondents). In the interviews, clinicians described how telepsychology interventions delivered in the home enabled the clinician to “see the family in their natural environment and all the factors that were contributing to family dynamics and issues.” This provided “greater ecological validity” and enabled the clinician to intervene in vivo and to develop/problem-solve strategies that were pertinent to the family’s lived experience in the home. Another advantage of online interventions included less caregiver stigma/negative attitudes toward treatment (62%), as families seemed to perceive online interventions as “less threatening” than attending a face-to-face sessions. In particular, clinicians reported that telepsychology was less stigmatizing and superior for engaging adolescents and promoting participation from fathers and siblings.Clinicians also rated telepsychology as offering greater ease of scheduling (54%). Clinicians reported that an online delivery afforded more flexibility with regard to their own schedules. For example, clinicians reported that they could offer evening hours and could deliver the intervention from their home office, which was convenient for them, and increased accessibility for families. In addition, clinicians described how an online delivery made it easier for families who lived far away from treatment centers to receive interventions, and reduced financial burden on families related to travel, transportation, and childcare costs for siblings not participating in the intervention, when applicable.Dimensions Where Telepsychology Is Equivalent to Face-to-Face InterventionClinicians rated most dimensions assessed (11 of 17) as being equivalent between telepsychology and face-to-face. For example, therapeutic alliance was rated as equivalent to face-to-face interventions (85%). In describing their experiences, clinicians reported feeling “skeptical about how the rapport would be (prior to delivering online interventions)” and some remarked feeling “extremely pleased” or “pleasantly surprised to see warmth and rapport were consistent (with face-to-face interventions).” Although most clinician reported no difference in establishing rapport (54%), most reported in the interviews that there were additional skills “needed to make those connections and establish rapport” when delivering interventions via telepsychology. Clinicians reported that this was something “you learn as you do telepsychology.” Extending from this, although most clinicians reported similar levels of clinician engagement (70%), 30% of clinicians reported experiencing less engagement when delivering telepsychology. In describing this during the interviews, some clinicians reported having to work harder to deliver telepsychology, as they needed to be cognizant of multiple factors, such as, technological aspects of the intervention, attending to nonverbal communication, and addressing disruptions during sessions.Other dimensions that were rated similarly included completion of homework (77%), as well as parent (85%) and child engagement (70%). Most clinicians rated attendance as being similar (54%) and some rated attendance in telepsychology to be superior (31%). In the focus groups, some clinicians reported that families tended to reschedule online appointments more often than face-to-face sessions, given the perceived flexibility; though attendance was reportedly similar. Overall, clinicians felt that family attendance was “more to do with family functioning than the type of intervention modality.” They expressed the belief that families who struggled with attendance for online interventions would likely have also had attendance problems for in-person interventions and vice versa.Dimensions Where Face-to-Face Intervention Is Superior to TelepsychologyThe greatest disadvantage clinicians reported of telepsychology relative to face-to-face interventions was amount of disruptions during session (92%). For example, clinicians reported online sessions being disrupted by “people or pets walking in,” “multiple kids’ demanding caregiver attention,” as well as other household-related issues such as needing to attend to food on the stove. In essence, by delivering telepsychology to families in their home, both families and clinicians had to contend with other household demands/distractions. Although part of the training and clinician manual for these telepsychology interventions addressed setting boundaries around home-based sessions and problem-solving with families to minimize distractions, this issue remained a challenge for clinicians.Another disadvantage was reading nonverbal communication (70%). Reading nonverbal cues was reported to be particularly difficult in family treatment when there were more family members participating, as not everyone’s face would be clearly in view on the screen. In addition, the emotional climate and family tension were also noted as more difficult to read via telehealth than face-to-face. The other greatest disadvantage of telepsychology was technical/logistical challenges (85%). In the interviews, clinicians reported that there were some families who struggled with the technological aspects of the interventions, and assisting with these issues posed an additional burden on the clinician. A few clinicians expressed the view that managing technical challenges during a session was a good opportunity for clinicians to model positive problem-solving skills. All clinicians expressed the belief that technological problems are becoming less of a challenge, as families are becoming more technologically savvy and web-technology is advancing and becoming easier to navigate. However, clinicians felt that even with these advances, there would remain a subset of families who are uncomfortable with technology and would prefer face-to-face interventions.Clinician Perceptions of Families Who Benefit Most From TelepsychologyThere were a number of family factors that clinicians consistently identified as impacting a family’s likelihood of benefiting from an online delivery more than face-to-face. Families living in rural areas or those requiring transportation to a treatment facility were identified as a population most likely to benefit, as these families would struggle to access traditional in-office care. In addition, families with fewer resources or complicated schedules (e.g., working parents, having many children in the home, families managing many injury-related appointments, etc.) were also identified as more suited to online interventions. In contrast, families living in large households or those in homes where there is no suitable private space to participate in telepsychology sessions, may be less able to benefit from online interventions.Several clinicians noted that cognitive and attention issues, which are common following TBI, sometimes posed challenges during telepsychology sessions. Specifically, clinicians reported difficulty maintaining child attention and engagement. Expanding on this, clinicians felt that they needed to work harder to engage this population of patients, compared to those without attention issues. It should be noted that therapists also expressed that they would need to provide greater structure whether the session was delivered online or in-person; however, many of the strategies used to provide structure for children or adolescents with cognitive impairments and/or challenging behavior during in-person sessions needed to be adapted for use during telehealth. Adolescents who were quiet or reluctant to engage in treatment were also noted as posing challenges, although some clinicians noted that this would be true regardless of the treatment modality. Conversely, some clinicians thought that being online and in their home environment mitigated resistance to treatment for some adolescents. A number of clinicians noted similar challenges with attention and engagement during telepsychology sessions for parents as well.Clinician Perceptions of Clinician Qualities That Support Telepsychology DeliveryClinicians identified a number of clinician qualities which they believed facilitated online delivery, such as flexibility and comfort addressing disruptions. For example, clinicians reported that they needed to feel comfortable checking-in with families about distractions in the home that may be impacting the session (e.g., “Who is behind the computer?” or “What are you looking at?”). Clinicians also felt that an online delivery required clinicians to be comfortable taking a more didactic role with families and feeling at-ease “teaching families” about technological aspects of the intervention and trouble-shooting technological issues. Other clinician qualities that were suited to telepsychology delivery included feeling confidence in the efficacy of telepsychology interventions, being “able to read the situation,” and the ability to anticipate and problem-solve challenges that may arise. As for qualities of clinicians that would be less suited to deliver telepsychology treatments, a number of clinicians reported that telepsychology interventions could be less intimate than face-to-face sessions, and clinicians who valued the intimacy of being in the same physical space may be less suited to telepsychology.DiscussionThis mixed-methods study elucidated several advantages and disadvantages of utilizing telepsychology in comparison to face-to-face therapy for family-centered treatment of pediatric TBI from a clinician perspective. Overall, clinicians reported that telepsychology was superior to face-to-face therapy in terms of scheduling/attendance, understanding the family and home environments, and reducing behavioral health stigma. Although some clinicians commented that establishing therapeutic alliance via telepsychology could be challenging and require unique clinical skills, a majority of clinicians reported that establishing therapeutic alliance was equivalent between online and face-to-face sessions. This is consistent with past research with parents who have reported comparable levels of therapeutic alliance between web-delivered therapy and face-to-face therapy (Backhaus et al., 2012; Lingely-Pottie & McGrath, 2006). Clinicians reported several challenges with utilizing telepsychology; the most prominent including distractions and reading nonverbal cues. In addition, technological issues invariably arose from time to time. However, clinicians reported that problem-solving around these challenges was an effective opportunity to model and practice skills in vivo. Given that a subset of families were not native technology users and were provided with unfamiliar computer equipment to support their participation, these challenges are likely heightened relative to telepsychology with computer-savvy families.Clinicians also identified several clinician and family characteristics that facilitated telepsychology. Clinicians believed that families who lived in rural areas and with low resources were most likely to benefit, whereas families with more chaotic home environments without a private space for teleconferencing would be less likely to benefit. Previous studies suggest that rural families may be ideal candidates for telepsychology, particularly because of federal initiatives to provide inexpensive Internet access in these areas (Nelson & Bui, 2010). Additionally, low-income families, in contrast to high-income families, were most likely to benefit from an online parenting skills training intervention for pediatric TBI (Raj et al., 2015). However, lower income families and caregivers with a lower education were also less likely to complete a web-based family problem-solving intervention (Blaha et al., 2015). Taken together, these findings suggest that families in more unstable/chaotic homes who likely need the most help may have the greatest difficulty finding the time and resources to participate in both telepsychology and face-to-face interventions. In this regard, clinicians underscored the importance of being flexible in response to family challenges and being assertive in establishing appropriate boundaries.Clinician perceptions can better be understood in the context of the parent’s satisfaction with the videoconference-based treatment sessions. Previous reports suggest that satisfaction with the teletherapy was consistently high, albeit with a minority of families preferring face-to-face treatment. In the initial study (Wade, Carey, & Wolfe, 2006), 100% of parents rated the sessions as moderately to extremely helpful, with approximately 80% rating them as moderately to extremely helpful relative to face-to-face treatment. In a subsequent trial (Wade et al., 2014), 96% rated the videoconferences as helpful overall, with 85% rating them as very or extremely helpful. Similarly, parent satisfaction ratings for the parent-skills coaching intervention indicated that 87% found the sessions helpful relative to traditional in-person treatment (Antonini et al., 2012). Comparisons of adolescent satisfaction among those who participated with their parents versus independently (Wade et al., 2017) also noted high levels of satisfaction with the videoconferences among the adolescents themselves. Although not possible in the current project, future research would benefit from understanding the characteristics of families and children who preferred face-to-face treatment and the extent to which those characteristics dovetailed with the therapist’s perspectives.The current findings must be understood in the context of the study’s limitations, which include a relatively small sample of predominantly female clinicians who were specifically hired to conduct telepsychology, and thus may not be representative of the broader population of psychologists. It is possible that male clinicians may have yielded different insights regard the merits and disadvantages of telehealth with this population. Moreover, only six clinicians had the experience of delivering the same treatment in both face-to-face and online modalities, and the other clinicians relied on comparisons of the telehealth interventions to similar face-to-face treatments. Unfortunately, there are few randomized, controlled trials directly comparing telepsychology and face-to-face interventions for children and families, in comparison with the adult literature (Slone et al., 2012). Such head-to-head trials can ultimately identify who is most likely to benefit from each modality. We did not assess the therapist’s theoretical orientation and thus were unable to examine its influence on their perceptions of telehealth. Time since delivering the telehealth interventions varied considerably, and recall may have been biased by the passage of time. Additionally, improved teleconferencing capabilities may have mitigated some of the earlier concerns. Another limitation of this project includes notetaking, as opposed to audio recording the focus groups and interviews. Three separate individuals took notes during the focus groups as a means of reducing the limitation of this methodology. An additional limitation is that the focus groups and interviews were conducted by the psychologist who provided supervision for the telehealth treatments, which could have contributed to participant reluctance to express criticism of telepsychology. However, the therapist surveys were de-identified, and the request to complete the survey came from a coauthor (rather than the supervising psychologist). In addition, clinicians were encouraged to be as honest as possible regarding their experiences, and a team approach was undertaken to analyze the results. Findings from the therapist survey and focus group/interviews were consistent suggesting that the noted limitations had minimal impact on reported information. A number of the limitations of this study are reflective of the current status of telepsychology, in that this is a growing field. This study focused on the delivery of telepsychology to a distinct pediatric rehabilitation population, and studies with larger samples of psychologists and pediatric populations are needed.There are several challenges regarding continued research and dissemination in the area of telepsychology, including ethical considerations regarding confidentiality and online security, as well as ensuring participant’s safety regarding suicidality concerns/threats (see guidance in Henderson, Law, Palermo, & Eccleston, 2012). Additionally, there are special considerations when treating children and families with telepsychology, including modifications based on developmental status and the level of family involvement (Hilty et al., 2016). Finally, telepsychology poses several issues in terms of dissemination in typical clinical practice, including reimbursement and requirements regarding licensure in multiple states. Overall, clinicians in this study have expressed high satisfaction with the application of telepsychology with children and families, which indicates promise for the acceptance and dissemination of telepsychology more widely.In closing, findings from this study provide an important foundation for future investigations examining the merits of telepsychology versus traditional treatment for pediatric populations. Future research could examine cost effectiveness, as well as the role that clinician and patient perceptions of telepsychology play in adherence and attrition. It may also be helpful to direct future research toward a better description of the specific clinician factors and process variables (e.g., therapeutic alliance, adherence, etc.) that facilitate rapport during telepsychology treatment. This information would be helpful for the development of training for future clinicians utilizing telepsychology to optimize treatment efficacy. The use of information and communication technologies has emerged as the next big frontier in the efficient and effective delivery of health care. The term “telemedicine” has been adopted to describe health care delivery via technology (Wilson & Maeder, 2015), including in mental health treatment delivery, where it is typically known as telepsychology. Telepsychology, the delivery of psychological services via technology, is a broad field and encompasses various delivery modalities and formats (Nelson, Bui, & Velasquez, 2011). It needs to be distinguished from other forms of telemedicine, such as telepsychiatry, which further includes the delivery of psychopharmacological interventions via technology. The various delivery modalities and formats include the use of mobile phone technology (e.g., short message service or application-based interventions), telephone-delivered therapy, video teleconferencing, Internet-delivered text-based therapy or treatment programs, and other formats such as using social media or video games as adjuncts to therapy. While these delivery formats vary in their specifics, such as being self-directed, guided self-help, or real-time interaction with a specialist, all are accessible to individuals with Internet and/or phone service and suitable equipment.An important distinction in telepsychology is between “synchronous” and “asynchronous” delivery methods (Wilson & Maeder, 2015). Synchronous telepsychology refers to visual and/or auditory interactions between the client and provider that are in real time and is therefore the most similar delivery format to traditional in-person treatment (Osenbach, O’Brien, Mishkind, & Smolenski, 2013). Synchronous interventions include telephone or video teleconference (VTC)–delivered treatments and Internet-delivered text-based treatments that involve real-time text interactions (often referred to as “webchat”). Asynchronous telepsychology involves client–provider interactions that are not in real time and thus includes interventions such as automated Internet or computer-based interventions or e-mail interactions with providers (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, 2015).Telepsychology is of particular relevance in countries that face geographical challenges in delivering health care (Mehrotra et al., 2016). Research shows that increasing location remoteness was consistently associated with lower service use, and this relationship was particularly strong for specialist mental health interventions (Meadows, Enticott, Inder, Russell, & Gurr, 2015). There is even further restriction on the availability of providers who specialize in the treatment of particularly complex mental health conditions, such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), in regional and remote areas (Frueh, 2015; Riding-Malon & Werth, 2014). Research suggests that common barriers to seeking or receiving mental health treatment in rural or remote areas include concerns about stigma (Wrigley, Jackson, Judd, & Komiti, 2005), geographical isolation, difficulty accessing appropriate transport, concerns about the cost of treatment, and perceived time commitment (Handley et al., 2014). Certain populations of treatment seekers may be particularly vulnerable to perceptions of stigma relating to mental health, as well as being rurally located, such as veterans (Frueh, 2015). Accessing treatment via telepsychology may reduce concerns about stigma, with treatment available in the privacy of one’s own home, which provides flexibility and allows optimum use of client and therapist time (Rees & Haythornthwaite, 2004).Evidence for the effectiveness of telepsychology has been emerging over the past decade. Systematic reviews that have combined both types of telepsychology, that is, synchronous and nonsynchronous, indicate that telepsychology is generally effective (Backhaus et al., 2012). However, previous reviews have included several different telepsychology modalities, with Internet based, computer based, telephone based, and video based included, together without examining or commenting on the difference between synchronous and nonsynchronous treatments. Synchronous treatment is the most similar treatment to traditional psychological treatments and therefore seems to be the logical place to start, to further our understanding of telepsychology. Common types of synchronous treatment include telephone-delivered, VTC-delivered, and Internet-delivered text-based modalities. It has been noted in the literature that these heterogeneous modalities are commonly grouped together (Osenbach et al., 2013), but it is important to explore whether there is differential evidence supporting each of these modalities. There has been only one previous systematic literature review that has focused specifically on synchronous telepsychology for the treatment of depression (Osenbach et al., 2013), and it concluded that it was as effective as nontelehealth means in reducing depression symptoms. In comparison, no literature reviews have assessed the evidence in relation to synchronous telepsychology for other common mental health conditions such as anxiety, PTSD, and adjustment disorder. It is important to develop an understanding of how effective synchronous telepsychology is likely to be for these disorders, as people experiencing these disorders are often geographically isolated, experiencing stigma, or experiencing physical injury. Another common mental health problem, substance abuse, has been the subject of several telepsychology reviews over the past few years (e.g., Benavides-Vaello, Strode, & Sheeran, 2013; Young, 2012) and as such will not be examined in the current review.The aim of this review is to determine the efficacy of synchronous telepsychology for the treatment of three common mental health disorders (anxiety, PTSD, and adjustment disorder) that have not yet been investigated through systematic review, in addition to updating the literature on synchronous telepsychology for the treatment of depression beyond the findings from Osenbach and colleagues (Osenbach et al., 2013). Given that the study focus is heterogeneous in respect to modality (all forms of synchronous telepsychology) and disorder (anxiety, PTSD, adjustment disorder, and depression), and given that telepsychology is a rapidly developing field, it is well suited to a rapid evidence assessment (REA) approach as opposed to a systematic review.MethodThis study utilized an REA methodology, which is a rigorous process that avoids a number of the challenges that face a systematic review, such as the time and resource cost (Crawford, Boyd, Jain, Khorsan, & Jonas, 2015; Varker et al., 2015). The key limitations of an REA methodology come from the restricted search period and the exclusion of unpublished, difficult-to-obtain, and/or foreign language studies (Varker et al., 2015). The steps of an REA methodology are outlined below.Defining the QuestionThe first stage of the REA is defining the population, intervention, comparison, and outcome (PICO), in the same manner as a systematic review (Crawford et al., 2015). The population of interest was defined as adults with a diagnosis of depression, anxiety, PTSD, or adjustment disorder (ascertained by diagnosis or cutoff score on a validated measure). The intervention was defined as any psychological intervention delivered using synchronous telepsychology. The comparison included studies with treatment as usual (TAU), in-person treatments, or alternative telepsychology intervention comparisons. The outcome was defined as change in mental health symptom severity.Search StrategyMedline, PsycINFO, and the Cochrane library were searched for peer-reviewed literature published from January 2005 to July 2016. Each database was single searched using the title(s), abstract(s), MeSH terms, and keywords lists with search terms specific to telepsychology, common mental health conditions (i.e., depression, PTSD, adjustment disorder, and anxiety), and study type. The interventions that were searched for were those that are typically used in the treatment of depression, PTSD, adjustment disorder, and anxiety. The following search terms were used: “major depressive disorder” OR depression OR PTSD OR “posttraumatic stress” OR “post-traumatic stress” OR “traumatic stress” OR “stress disorder” OR anxiety OR “GAD” OR “generali*ed anxiety disorder” OR “anxiety disorder” OR phobia OR panic OR “adjustment disorder” AND “cognitive behavioral therapy” OR “cognitive behavioral therapy” OR CBT OR “cognitive processing therapy” OR “cognitive therapy” OR “dialectical behavior therapy” OR “dialectical behavior therapy” OR “behavior therapy” OR “behavior therapy” OR exposure OR “imaginal exposure” OR “in vivo exposure” OR “motivational interviewing” OR “acceptance and commitment therapy” OR “mindfulness” OR “schema therapy” OR “interpersonal therapy” OR EMDR OR “eye movement desensitization and reprocessing” OR “narrative therapy” OR “solution focused therapy” OR “solution focused therapy” OR “psychiatric consultation” OR therapy OR treatment OR counseling OR intervention AND telepsychology, OR telemedicine, OR e-health, OR telehealth, OR telephone, OR “mobile phone” OR video, OR videoconferencing, OR skype, OR face-time, OR Internet, OR online, OR web, OR web-based, OR Internet-based OR Internet-delivered OR telephone-based OR telephone-delivered OR web-delivered AND “systematic review” OR “meta-analysis” OR RCT OR “randomi*ed controlled trial” OR “control trial” OR “effectiveness trial” OR “control study” OR “clinical trial.”Study SelectionStudies were included if they were published in English; were peer-reviewed meta-analyses, systematic reviews, or randomized controlled trials (RCTs); involved adults (≥ 18 years of age); used psychological interventions delivered by synchronous telepsychology; included participants with a diagnosis or cutoff score indicating an anxiety disorder, major depressive disorder, PTSD, or adjustment disorder; and where trial outcomes included mental health symptom severity. Studies were excluded where asynchronous telepsychology modalities were used. One author (R.M.B.) initially screened the studies based on title and abstract and obtained the full-text papers that satisfied the inclusion criteria. The full-text papers were then screened for inclusion, with 10% of these randomly selected and checked by a second author (T.V.) for agreement. This meant that these papers were reviewed by the second author for eligibility as per the inclusion/exclusion criteria. Of the 10% checked by both reviewers, there was 100% interrater agreement. Any disagreements between reviewers would have been resolved by discussion or through adjudication by a third author (A.P.). If a meta-analysis selected for inclusion in the REA included a study that was also found as an independent article, then the individual study was not included or counted for the purposes of the current review and was only reported on as part of the meta-analysis.Quality AssessmentThe quality of included research studies was appraised using the criteria from the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) checklist (NHMRC, 1999), which considers the following four study features: the method of treatment assignment (i.e., correct blinding and randomization), control of selection bias (i.e., intention to treat and dropout rate), blinding of outcome assessor, and whether standardized assessment was used. The quality of systematic reviews and meta-analyses was assessed using NHMRC quality criteria (NHMRC, 2000), which consider the adequacy of the search strategy, appropriateness of the inclusion criteria, presence of quality assessment for individual studies, summary of the results of individual studies, and quantitative synthesis of results (where relevant). An overall rating of the quality of each study is provided in Table 2.TABLES AND FIGUREStable/figure thumbnailTable 2. Research Evaluating the Effectiveness of Synchronous Telemedicine-Delivered Psychological Interventions for Clients With High-Prevalence Mental Health ConditionsView larger image > in this page > in new window> Download slideThe results of these quality assessments were then used to inform the overall strength of the evidence.Ranking the Overall EvidenceThe evidence was evaluated using five criteria (Merlin, Weston, & Tooher, 2009): the strength of the evidence, in terms of the quality, quantity, and design of the included studies; the direction of the findings; the consistency of the findings across the included studies (including across a range of study populations and study designs); and the generalizability (of the body of evidence to the target population) and applicability of the findings to the population of interest, as defined by the PICO. Three independent raters (R.M.B., T.V., and J.W.) made ratings about the strength of the evidence, direction of the findings, consistency of the findings, generalizability, and applicability. Strength of the evidence was based on the following categories: high strength, where there is one or more systematic review or meta-analysis of RCTs with a low risk of bias (i.e., risk of there being a systematic error in the results, which can lead to underestimation or overestimation of the true intervention effect), or three or more RCTs with a low risk of bias; moderate strength, where there is one or two RCTs with a low risk of bias; and low strength, where there is one or more RCT with a high risk of bias. The direction of the findings was judged in terms of whether the weight of the evidence showed positive results, unclear results (i.e., no significant effects or mixed results), or negative results. Further details on the methods for making each of these judgments for each of the five criteria are detailed in Varker et al. (2015).The strength of the evidence, the direction of the findings, and the consistency of the findings reflect the internal validity of the findings in support of efficacy for an intervention. The last two components considered the external factors that may influence effectiveness. On the basis of these five factors, the total body of the evidence was then ranked into one of four categories: “Supported,” “Promising,” “Unknown,” and “Not Supported.” A ranking of “Supported” means that there is clear, consistent evidence of a beneficial effect with no evidence suggesting a negative or harmful effect. “Promising” means that the evidence is suggestive of a beneficial effect but further information is required. An “Unknown” ranking means that there is insufficient evidence of a beneficial effect and further research is required, and “Not Supported” means there is clear, consistent evidence of no effect or negative/harmful effect (Varker et al., 2015). Agreement on ranking was sought between three independent raters (T.V., R.M.B., and J.W.), with 100% interrater agreement found. Discrepancies between the raters would have been resolved through discussion.ResultsFigure 1TABLES AND FIGUREStable/figure thumbnailFigure 1. Flowchart of search for studies.View larger image > in this page > in new window> Download slideshows the yield at all stages of the review. After removing duplicate articles from an initial yield of 2,266 articles, 2,196 articles were screened on title and abstract and 206 were deemed eligible for full-text review. After the full-text review stage, 24 articles were deemed eligible for inclusion. Given the relatively small number of articles identified in the REA, the studies were grouped by telepsychology modality to provide the most meaningful results possible, regardless of the mental health disorder addressed in the study.Of the 24 articles included in the review, 8 studies (Brenes, Danhauer, Lyles, Hogan, & Miller, 2015; Dwight-Johnson et al., 2011; Gellis, Kenaley, & Have, 2014; Lovell et al., 2006; Ludman, Simon, Tutty, & Von Korff, 2007; Mohr, Carmody, Erickson, Jin, & Leader, 2011; Mohr et al., 2005, 2012) and 1 meta-analysis (Mohr, Vella, Hart, Heckman, & Simon, 2008) investigated the effectiveness of telephone-delivered interventions for depression; 10 studies (Acierno et al., 2016; Choi et al., 2014; Egede et al., 2015; Fortney et al., 2015; Morland et al., 2014, 2015; Stubbings, Rees, Roberts, & Kane, 2013; Vogel et al., 2014; Yuen et al., 2015; Ziemba et al., 2014) and 1 systematic review, which included 20 studies (Rees & Maclaine, 2015), investigated the effectiveness of VTC-delivered interventions for anxiety disorders; 2 further studies investigated Internet-delivered text-based interventions (Kessler et al., 2009; Kramer, Conijn, Oijevaar, & Riper, 2014); and 1 meta-analysis (Osenbach et al., 2013) investigated the effectiveness of multiple telepsychology modalities in the treatment of depression, while another meta-analysis investigated the effectiveness of multiple telepsychology modalities in the treatment of mood or functional mental health problems (Bee et al., 2008). The majority of the studies were conducted in the United States (n = 15), with studies also conducted in Europe (n = 4) and Australia (n = 1). A summary of the key characteristics of the included studies is described below and presented in Table 1.TABLES AND FIGUREStable/figure thumbnailTable 1. Characteristics of the Studies Investigating Synchronous Telepsychology InterventionsView larger image > in this page > in new window> Download slideThe overall findings for each intervention type are presented below and in Table 2.Telephone-Delivered InterventionsOverall, 11 studies investigated the effectiveness of telephone-delivered psychological interventions. Two meta-analyses looked at a range of telepsychology modalities, including telephone-delivered therapy (Bee et al., 2008; Osenbach et al., 2013), while a third meta-analysis looked specifically at telephone-delivered psychotherapy for depression (Mohr et al., 2008). Eight individual RCTs assessed telephone-delivered therapy for a range of disorders (i.e., generalized anxiety disorder, depression, and obsessive–compulsive disorder), with TAU comparisons (Dwight-Johnson et al., 2011; Gellis et al., 2014; Ludman et al., 2007; Mohr et al., 2011), in-person therapy comparisons (Lovell et al., 2006; Mohr et al., 2012), and telepsychology comparisons (Brenes et al., 2015; Mohr et al., 2005).Overall, the strength of the evidence for telephone-delivered therapy was rated as high, given that there were three meta-analyses, one of which had a low risk of bias (Bee et al., 2008) and two of which had a moderate risk of bias (Mohr et al., 2008; Osenbach et al., 2013), which had results supporting the use of telephone-delivered therapy. In addition to this, there were several other high-quality individual RCTs (Brenes et al., 2015; Dwight-Johnson et al., 2011; Gellis et al., 2014; Lovell et al., 2006; Ludman et al., 2007; Mohr et al., 2011, 2012). The direction of the evidence was judged to be positive, since all studies except for one reported that telephone-delivered therapy was as effective as standard in-person treatment or was better than TAU on a range of outcomes. One study did not find a significant difference in improvement between telephone-delivered cognitive–behavioral therapy (T-CBT) and TAU groups (Mohr et al., 2011), but given the strong positive weight of the rest of the evidence, this finding was judged not to be significant enough to lower the direction rating to “Unclear.” The consistency of the findings was judged to be moderate to high, as the majority of studies reported similar trends in the findings, with telephone-delivered therapy being as effective as TAU or standard in-person treatments. Specifically, T-CBT was found to be as effective as in-person treatments in noninferiority trials (i.e., trials comparing a novel treatment to an existing standard treatment) but was found to be superior to TAU. Given that the majority of studies were consistent in their findings, it was determined that these results are highly likely to be replicable. The generalizability of these studies was rated as moderate to high, as the studies included a range of disorders and samples. The applicability of these findings was judged to be high, as the treatments and delivery formats are highly relevant and applicable to a Western health system. Thus, given the high strength, positive direction, moderate to high consistency, moderate to high generalizability, and high applicability, the use of telephone-delivered telepsychology for clients with mental health conditions was ranked as “Supported.”Video Teleconference–Delivered InterventionsTwelve studies were identified that investigated the effectiveness of VTC-delivered interventions. One meta-analytic review looked at a range of telepsychology modalities, including VTC (Osenbach et al., 2013); one systematic review of VTC was identified (Rees & Maclaine, 2015) and 10 individual RCTs were also found, all of which used in-person intervention comparisons (Acierno et al., 2016; Choi et al., 2014; Egede et al., 2015; Fortney et al., 2015; Morland et al., 2014, 2015; Stubbings et al., 2013; Vogel et al., 2014; Yuen et al., 2015; Ziemba et al., 2014), other than one study that used a self-help book on evidence-based exposure and response prevention or waitlist comparison (Vogel et al., 2014).Overall, the strength of the evidence base for VTC-delivered telepsychology interventions was rated as high. This rating was primarily based on the presence of five high-quality RCTs with a low risk of bias (Acierno et al., 2016; Egede et al., 2015; Fortney et al., 2015; Morland et al., 2014; Yuen et al., 2015). The remaining RCTs in the VTC literature yield were rated as being at moderate or high risk of bias due to methodological issues such as small sample sizes, high dropouts (i.e., >25%), or lack of blinding of assessors (i.e., the assessors were aware of the treatment condition; Choi et al., 2014; Morland et al., 2015; Stubbings et al., 2013; Vogel et al., 2014; Ziemba et al., 2014). The direction of the evidence was rated as positive, with all studies finding that VTC-delivered therapy had results showing it was as effective as in-person therapy and one study finding that VTC-delivered therapy was superior to using a self-help book on evidence-based exposure and response prevention, as well as a waitlist control (Vogel et al., 2014). The consistency was rated as high, as all studies were consistent in their findings. The generalizability of the evidence base was rated as moderate to high, with the samples in the studies representative of adults with mental health conditions. Of note, however, six of the included studies focused solely on U.S. veteran populations. The applicability was also judged to be high as all treatments offered in the studies were considered to be available in a Western health system. Taken together, the high strength, positive direction, high consistency, moderate to high generalizability, and high applicability of the VTC studies led to the use of VTC-delivered telepsychology for clients with mental health conditions being ranked as “Supported.”Internet-Delivered Text-Based TreatmentsThree studies were identified that investigated the effectiveness of psychotherapy delivered via the Internet, in which therapists and clients communicated in real time through type-written responses (webchats). A meta-analysis by Bee and colleagues (2008) looked at psychotherapy delivered via a range of telepsychology modalities, including the Internet, and two individual RCTs assessed Internet-delivered text-based therapy for depression with TAU comparison groups (Kessler et al., 2009; Kramer, Conijn, Oijevaar, & Riper, 2014).The evidence base for Internet-delivered text-based therapy was judged to be of low strength, as it primarily consisted of two RCTs that were judged to be of low quality and have a high risk of selection bias (Kessler et al., 2009; Kramer et al., 2014). Although there was one meta-analysis, this study did not provide enough information to assess the individual merits of Internet-delivered text-based therapy and did not contribute to improving the strength of the evidence (Bee et al., 2008). The findings from the two RCTs were in the same positive direction, and the consistency was judged to be low to moderate as only two studies were included. The generalizability was judged to be moderate as one study used adults while the other used young people (i.e., where the mean age of the sample was 19.5 years). The applicability was rated as high, as the treatments were considered to be applicable and relevant to the Western health system, given the treatments are available in Western settings. Given the positive direction, low to moderate consistency, moderate generalizability, high applicability, but low strength of the evidence, the effectiveness of Internet-delivered text-based interventions for the treatment of mental health conditions, including depression, anxiety, PTSD, and adjustment disorder, was considered to be “Unknown.”DiscussionThe aim of this REA was to assess the effectiveness of telepsychology for clients with depression, anxiety, PTSD, or adjustment disorders. The reviewed literature suggests that there is a fast-growing evidence base in this area. The REA found that the evidence base is currently strongest and of the highest quality in the area of telephone-delivered and VTC-delivered interventions. Both telephone-delivered and VTC interventions met the criteria for a “Supported” treatment for mental health conditions, meaning that there is clear, consistent evidence of beneficial effect.The “Supported” rating for telephone-delivered interventions was informed by three meta-analyses (two of good quality with few risk of bias issues and one with moderate quality and bias issues) and several high-quality RCTs, all of which indicated that telephone-delivered interventions are significantly more effective than TAU and, in noninferiority trials, are as effective as standard in-person treatments. Of note, there was one high-quality RCT with U.S. veterans that did not find a significant difference in outcomes for T-CBT for depression in comparison to a TAU group (Mohr et al., 2011). The authors suggest that this may be evidence that more treatment resistant groups, such as veterans, may need more intensive approaches to treatment than telephone-delivered therapy. The authors also question whether there may be a publication bias in the literature for telephone-delivered interventions, in which null results are not being routinely published. Alternatively, it may be the case that there is generally very little research being conducted on telephone-delivered interventions. This needs to be noted in an appraisal of the evidence base for telephone-delivered interventions for mental health conditions, but given the specific population in the study (veterans) and the strong weight of evidence in contrast to the findings of this study, it was not considered to be enough to lower the overall “Supported” ranking for telephone-delivered interventions for mental health conditions.In the case of VTC-delivered interventions, the “Supported” rating was informed primarily by five high-quality RCTs with a low risk of bias. Notably, these five RCTs were all conducted in the United States with veteran populations (Acierno et al., 2016; Egede et al., 2015; Fortney et al., 2015; Morland et al., 2014; Yuen et al., 2015). Veterans are a specific population who may benefit from VTC interventions, given that they are a group with particularly high rates of mental health conditions (Ikin et al., 2004; Searle, Lawrence-Wood, Saccone, & McFarlane, 2013) and with documented barriers to accessing appropriate evidence-based treatments (Brooks et al., 2012). This is likely to be the reason for a proliferation of recent research into telepsychology-delivered interventions in veteran populations particularly.The evidence for Internet-delivered text-based synchronous interventions for mental health conditions was limited and primarily consisted of two RCTs judged to be of only moderate quality due to a lack of control of selection bias (Kessler et al., 2009; Kramer et al., 2014). These RCTs suggested that Internet-delivered text-based synchronous interventions (by webchat) were superior to waitlist control, specifically in treating depression. Given the lack of high-quality evidence in this area, the use of Internet-delivered text-based synchronous interventions for mental health conditions was ranked as “Unknown,” indicating that there is insufficient evidence of a beneficial effect, and further methodologically rigorous research across different populations and mental health conditions is needed.The technology involved in telepsychology interventions is relatively new, particularly in the case of VTC-delivered interventions. This is reflected in the fact that all of the VTC studies were conducted after 2013, with the more than half having been published in the last year. It is therefore likely that the evidence base for VTC interventions in particular will continue to grow at a rapid rate in the coming years.Limitations and Future DirectionsThe findings must be considered alongside the limitations of an REA. The omission of potentially important papers, including those that were unpublished, not in English, and published prior to 2005, limits the comprehensiveness of an REA (Varker et al., 2015). The evaluations of the evidence were not as exhaustive as in a systematic review or meta-analysis methodology, and the study results were not synthesized in a statistical way. The REA focused specifically on adults, meaning the relevance of these findings to children and adolescents is unknown. The majority of the included studies were conducted in Western settings, which limits the generalizability to non-Western countries. In addition, the scope of this review was guided by the funders of the research and therefore limited to anxiety, depression, PTSD, and adjustment disorder. As such, several other important psychiatric disorders were not investigated. Finally, due to the fact that this was an REA, data from the studies included in this review were not meta-analyzed. This is a limitation of the REA methodology, in comparison to systematic reviews that often include meta-analysis.An important direction for future research is to repeat and extend the current research, with the inclusion of meta-analysis. It will be important to identify which populations benefit most from telepsychology and to also identify whether adverse effects are observed in any populations. In addition, the current review revealed that relatively few RCTs have been conducted on Internet-delivered text-based interventions, and those that have been done have had methodological limitations. Therefore, there is a need for further well-designed RCTs to examine the efficacy of Internet-delivered text-based interventions.ConclusionsBased on the findings of this REA, both telephone- and VTC-delivered interventions for mental health conditions are “Supported” by the current available evidence. Synchronous Internet-delivered text-based interventions require further methodologically rigorous RCTs and reviews in order to provide more robust data on their effectiveness. The potential for telepsychology to overcome common barriers to treatment access and its apparent efficacy and equivalence to in-person treatments therefore suggests that it is a promising delivery method for increasing the reach of evidence-based psychological interventions. This may be of particular use for those in rural and remote communities who have significant issues with access to evidence-based psychological therapies. Given that these are relatively new technologies, which are increasing in their mass availability, it will also be important to watch the evidence in this area over the next 5–10 years. Behavioral health (BH) problems among children and adolescents are common, with at least one in five suffering from a disorder and others at risk (Patel, Flisher, Hetrick, & McGorry, 2007). Many e-BH care options like websites, chat groups, apps, texts, and wearable sensors are being used with in-person and video telebehavioral health (TBH; Hilty, Chan, Torous, Mahautmr, & Mucic, 2015; Hilty, Rabinowitz, et al., 2018; Odgers & Jensen, 2020; Russell & Gajos, 2020; Sequeira et al., 2020; Odgers & Jensen, 2020). Treatments that rely less on specialized human resources like mobile health, if feasible and effective, could create scalable approaches at a population level (World Health Organization, 2017), particularly in collaboration with pediatricians/primary care providers (PCPs).Video adult studies and guidelines (American Telemedicine Association [ATA], 2009, 2013; Hilty, Ferrer, et al., 2013; Hubley, Lynch, Schneck, Thomas, & Shore, 2016) preceded child and adolescent developments related to assessment, management, collaborative care and guidelines (ATA, 2017; Coffey, Vanderlip, & Sarvet, 2017; Myers, Vander Stoep, Zhou, McCarty, & Katon, 2015; Nelson & Patton, 2016; Nelson & Sharp, 2016). Mobile health, social media, and wearable sensors are effectively used to assess and treat patients of all ages (Aboujaoude & Salame, 2016; Archangeli, Marti, Wobga-Pasiah, & Zima, 2017; Fedele, Cushing, Fritz, Amaro, & Ortega, 2017; Russell & Gajos, 2020; Sequeira et al., 2020). Child and adolescent patients, parents, and families have played an instrumental role in many ways: development and pretesting technology (Hetrick et al., 2018; Whittaker et al., 2008); ensuring wearable sensors really work day-to-day (e.g., water or contact sports); and providing feedback to for visuals, chat options, and communication methods with clinicians (Anderson et al., 2018; Thompson, Goodwin, Ojeda, Morris, & Fairman, 2020; Russell & Gajos, 2020).Competencies in information technology were suggested as part of health care reform in 2003 (National Academy of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine 2020). Most of the competency work has been done for video in adults, though it may apply to children and adolescents (Hilty et al., 2015; Hilty, Maheu, et al., 2018; Maheu et al., 2020). Social media (Hilty, Zalpuri, et al., 2018), mobile health (Hilty, Chan, Torous, Luo, & Boland, 2020), wearable sensors (Hilty, Armstrong, Luxton, Gentry, & Krupinski, 2020), and asynchronous (Hilty, Torous, et al., 2020) competencies have also been done for adults, though they may apply more to children and adolescents. There are no specific telecompetencies for children, adolescents and families, but there are good telepsychiatry toolkits (American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry [AACAP] Committee on, Telepsychiatry and AACAP Committee on Quality Issues, 2017; American Psychiatric Association-AACAP, 2020).The overarching goal is to use identify clinician behaviors (i.e., skills or competencies) to ensure quality of care for child and adolescent patients and further training. We report general findings applicable to all ages, as some findings overlap for children, adolescents, young adults, and adults, but point out meaningful distinctions between the groups.MethodApproachThe literature key word search was conducted from January 2000 to March 2020. The philosophical approach to the search was done according to the original six-stage process (Arksey & O’Malley, 2005) and updated modifications (Levac, Colquhoun, & O’Brien, 2010) for scoping reviews.The Research QuestionThe question that guided the review was, “What skills are needed for clinicians and trainees to provide quality care using asynchronous technologies for children and adolescents, and how can they be made measurable to implement, teach and evaluate?” Within that question, there are other questions including (a) What steps have researchers, organizations and others taken to establish technological competencies, specifically, asynchronous competencies? (b) How can asynchronous competencies be organized in a competency-based education framework, in terms of components, concepts, and processes? (c) What administrative approaches can facilitate asynchronous clinical care, education/training, and evaluation in order for positive implementation and sustainability?Identifying Relevant Studies: The Search StrategyA literature key word search from January 2000 to March, 2020 used the following databases: Pubmed/Medline, APA PsycNET, PsycINFO, Embase, Web of Science, Scopus, and Social Sciences Citation Index. The initial literature search targeted four concept areas related to the behavioral health care of children and adolescents: (a) competencies (behavior, cognition, cognitive, curriculum, education, framework, learner, pedagogy, skill, training, Milestones); (b) asynchronous technologies (app, device, eConsult, e-consult, e-mail, mobile, monitoring, sensor, social media, store-and-forward, text, wearable); (c) synchronous telepsychiatry, telebehavioral or telemental health (video, web-based, Internet; since asynchronous technologies often added); and (d) clinical therapeutic relationship (behavior, boundaries, care, communication, connect, engagement, empathy, family, intimacy, outcome, parent, play, psychotherapy, system, therapeutic, therapy, training, trust, youth). Studies that focused predominantly on interventions for parents, substance use, well-being/prevention, and pregnant/parenting themes were not included.Study SelectionAn iterative process was used to search the literature, refine the search strategy, and review articles for study inclusion. Two authors (DH, JT) independently, in parallel, screened the potentially relevant studies based on titles and abstracts. Full-text articles were reviewed using inclusion criteria: key words used from concept area 1 (competencies) and 2 (asynchronous telehealth) used in combination with 3 (telehealth mode) or 4 (clinical). Exclusion criteria are shown in Figure 1.TABLES AND FIGUREStable/figure thumbnailFigure 1. Search flow chart: Diagram of studies and other papers reviewed.View larger image > in this page > in new window> Download slideWhen disagreements on study inclusion occurred, a third reviewer (IZ) determined the outcome.Charting the DataA data-charting form was not developed and used, but notes were organized and a descriptive/narrative analytical method was used to summarize the process and content information from the articles and discussions with experts, in an effort to chart and summarize complex concepts.Analysis, Reporting, and Considering the Meaning of the FindingsBecause there were so few articles, findings were reported individually and excerpts from published framework tables—mostly for adult care—were organized into a table and contextualized inclusively for adolescent, children and families, if applicable. The Accreditation Council of Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) Milestone framework was selected, as it is well known across medicine and by some BH professions (ACGME, 2013).Consultation for Expert OpinionExpert option was solicited to review preliminary findings and suggest changes by (a) a series of medical educator conference calls focused on competencies, based on previous work (Hilty, Crawford, et al., 2015; Zalpuri et al., 2018); (b) regular conference calls with clinicians and researchers of international organizations (e.g., ATA, American Psychiatric Association, Coalition for Technology in Behavioral Science [CTiBS]); (c) outreach to representatives of BH professions, based on past consensus processes (Maheu, Drude, Hertlein, & Hilty, 2018); and (d) discussions with individuals referred by the conference calls. Participants included chairs, deans, course/program directors, national society executive directors, officers, and journal editors.ResultsLiteratureFigure 1 shows that from a total of 5,877 potential references, two authors (DH, JT) found 5,567 eligible for title and abstract review and found 519 articles eligible for full text review as directly relevant to the concept areas in combination. Of the eligible studies, 409 were excluded, leaving a total of 110 articles.Overview of Synchronous and Asynchronous Technologies and WorkflowClinical care in-person, by video, telephone and via asynchronous technologies have similarities and differences (Hilty, Parish et al., 2020; Hilty, Torous, et al., 2020; Hilty, Maheu, Drude, & Hertlein, 2018; Lyneham & Rapee, 2005; Yellowlees et al., 2018). Technology may change the nature of interaction for participants in terms of exchange of information, clarity, responsiveness and comfort, depending on their digital literacy (e.g., digital natives and immigrants; ATA, 2017; American Psychiatric Association and American Telemedicine Association, 2018; Hilty et al., 2013; Myers & Turvey, 2013; Maheu et al., 2018; Wang, Myers, & Sundaram, 2013). Technology integration into workflow (e.g., clinic, communication, policy, procedures) takes effort to ensure quality and medico-legal issues are addressed (see Table 1;TABLES AND FIGUREStable/figure thumbnailTable 1. A Comparison of Synchronous and Asynchronous Care Dimensions: Clinical, Technical, and Administrative WorkflowView larger image > in this page > in new window> Download slideHilty, Torous, et al., 2020). Financial, policy, and other mandates have yet to be sorted (e.g., managing emergencies; Edwards-Stewart, Alexander, Armstrong, Hoyt, & O’Donohue, 2019; Hilty, Torous, et al., 2020).Behavioral Health Profession and International Telemedicine and Country Competencies, Position Statements, and Guidelines on Asynchronous TechnologiesA comparison of BH professions’ best practices, guidelines, and position statements for clinicians to adjust to video and asynchronous technologies shows more work on adult rather than child and adolescent care (see Table 2).TABLES AND FIGUREStable/figure thumbnailTable 2. A Comparison of Behavioral Professional Guidelines and Position Statements Related to Asynchronous TechnologiesView larger image > in this page > in new window> Download slideContributions come from: psychiatry/medicine (American Psychiatric Association, 2014, 2017; American Psychiatric Association-ATA, 2018); psychology (Australian Psychological Society, 2011; American Psychological Association [APA], 2013; 2019; Association of State and Provincial Psychology Boards, 2014; British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy, 2019; Canadian Psychological Association, 2006; Goss, Anthony, Jamieson, & Palmer, 2001); social work (National Association of Social Workers [NASW], 2005; NASW, Association of Social Work Boards, Council on Social Work Education, and Clinical Social Work Association, 2017); counseling (American Counseling Association, 2014; Canadian Counselling and Psychotherapy Association Technology and Innovative Solutions, 2019); couple/marriage/family (American Association for Marriage and Family Therapy [AAMFT], 2015a, 2015b; Association of Marriage and Family Therapy Regulatory Boards, 2016); the ATA; and the American Psychiatric Association-ATA Guideline (2018). Most guidelines focus on video and sparingly mention e-mail, e-consultation, social media or texting (ATA, 2009, 2013; American Psychiatric Association and American Telemedicine Association, 2018; Hilty, Crawford, et al., 2015; Hilty, Maheu, et al., 2018; Maheu et al., 2018, 2020).The U.S. AACAP (2017), the ATA Child and Adolescent Telemental Health Guideline (2017) and AACAP-American Psychiatric Association (2019) specifically focus on child and adolescent video; the ATA Guideline more purposely discussed apps, asynchronous, e-mail, e-consultation, monitoring, social media, text, and wearables (ATA, 2017). A more substantial discussion of asynchronous technology began in the U.S. with competencies published for social media (Hilty, Zalpuri, et al., 2018; Zalpuri et al., 2018), mobile health (Hilty, Chan, Torous, Luo, & Boland, 2019a; 2019b, 2020), and asynchronous care (Hilty, Torous, et al., 2020).Specific Asynchronous Technology ModesE-mail, text, and appse-Mail interviewing with young populations is cost-effective, offers flexibility, provides a transcript for analysis, and offers time to reflect on questions, compose answers, and respond at leisure from home surroundings (Cleary & Walter, 2011). Text-based mobile health interventions are used for reminders, information, supportive messages, and self-monitoring (Berrouiguet, Baca-García, Brandt, Walter, & Courtet, 2016; Senanayake et al., 2019). Keyboard characters and emoticons may enrich communication and comprehension (Aldunate & González-Ibáñez, 2017), though they are not always used in a standard way, particularly across cultures (Hilty, Randhawa, et al., 2020). Apps are used for health, well-being, and clinical topics like homelessness, suicide, substance use (Bry, Chou, Miguel, & Comer, 2018; Glover et al., 2019; Perry, Werner-Seidler, Calear, & Christensen, 2016; Pisani et al., 2018; Stoll, Pina, Gary, & Amresh, 2017; Senanayake et al., 2019; Wyman et al., 2010). Youth and their parents/guardians often need guidance how to check the quality of apps (i.e., evidence-based; Grist, Porter, & Stallard, 2017). Challenges of these technologies include verification of self-report, potentially compromised rapport, technical glitches, biased samples, quality control, confidentiality, and security (Hilty, Randhawa, et al., 2020).Sensors and wearablesStudies of biobehavioral sensing, machine learning, and wearable technologies in the form of patches or bandages, wristbands, rings, shirts, smartwatches, and smart glasses show largely positive outcomes (Mackintosh et al., 2019; Sequeira et al., 2020), including for cognitive–behavioral therapy to treat depression and anxiety, socialization for autism, and aggression with autism (Goodwin, Mazefsky, Ioannidis, Erdogmus, & Siegel, 2019; Hollis, Falconer, Martin, Whittington, Stockton, Glazebrook, & Davies, 2017; Voss et al., 2019). Wearable sensors facilitate ecological momentary assessment (EMA) and EM intervention (EMI; Hollis et al., 2017; Russell & Gajos, 2020). Competencies for wearable sensors have been suggested to assess patient needs, facilitate interactivity (e.g., chat, feedback), and use decision support within the EHR (Hilty, Armstrong, et al., 2020).e-consultatione-Consultation (i.e., e-consult or eConsult) generally involves a pediatrician/PCP referral for a consultation related to questions outside of their expertise (Hilty, Ingraham, Yang, & Anders, 2004; Hilty et al., 2013; Liddy, Drosinis, & Keely, 2016; Sarvet et al., 2010; Yellowlees, Hilty, Marks, Neufeld, & Bourgeois, 2008). Results also showed consultants have a short response time than for in-person or video options (i.e., a few days rather than weeks or months), high satisfaction by users with ease of completion, and a reduced need for in-person and video visits.Store-and-forward/asynchronous technologyStore-and-forward technologies have the specialist interpret an image, video (e.g., asynchronous telepsychiatry) or other data, while incorporating clinical history, to give the pediatrician/PCP a plan to implement (Hilty, Torous, et al., 2020; Yellowlees et al., 2018). This could also be employed for collaborative, stepped, and integrated care e.g., train a pediatrician/PCP or other team member to do the semistructured interview (Hilty, Torous, et al., 2020).Opportunities and Challenges With Asynchronous TechnologiesShifts in moving from in-person and synchronous care to asynchronous careSeveral paradigm shifts are happening with technology-based care. One shift is integrating technology into traditional health care or adapting that care to technology. Social media is integral to adolescents and young adults and therefore part of care (Hilty, Zalpuri, et al., 2018; Zalpuri et al., 2018), so the clinician needs to systematically screen technology use and for what purpose(s; e.g., entertainment, health care, BH), as well as exposure to risks (e.g., self-disclosure, cyberbullying, privacy; Hilty et al., 2019b; Joshi, Stubbe, Li, & Hilty, 2019; Krishna, 2017; Parish & Yellowlees, 2014).Another shift is that technology outside the office creates a new, previously impossible, sense of continuity, connection, and ease of communication—and this affect the therapeutic frame, expectations, boundaries, and trust (Hilty, Randhawa, et al., 2020). Text-based communication has a sense of immediacy and interaction that builds “trust,” while transcending time and space, but there may be negative consequences (Hilty, Randhawa, et al., 2020). Online communication may improve patient satisfaction (e.g., better access), and online (only) therapeutic modalities have reasonable engagement (Krishna, 2017).A third shift is how to integrate mobile health, text, sensors, social media, and other technologies into clinical workflow—into the treatment plan and in conjunction with in-person care. In-time data collection can be used to alert a patient or clinician to take action, based on more valid, reliable and meaningful data (Chan, Li, Torous, Gratzer, & Yellowlees, 2018; Grist, Cliffe, Denne, Croker, & Stallard, 2018; Kenny, Dooley, & Fitzgerald, 2016). Care is need to ensure therapeutic rapport, avoid miscommunications and misunderstandings, and prevent problems with privacy and boundaries (e.g., no after-hours texting, not using mobile phone for professional care).Health System and Institutional Approaches to Technology CompetenciesOverviewCompetency-based education focuses on clinical skill development in addition to knowledge acquisition (Iobst et al., 2010; Northey & Gehart, 2019). Clinical informatics Milestones were suggested for the EHR, data use (e.g., safety, quality, privacy), and clinical decision support (Hersh et al., 2014). These were followed by adult competency sets for telepsychiatry (Hilty, Crawford, et al., 2015; Hilty, Maheu, et al., 2018), TBH (Maheu et al., 2018, 2020), social media (2018; Hilty, Zalpuri, et al., 2018; Zalpuri et al., 2018), mobile health (Hilty et al., 2019a; 2019b, 2020), wearable sensors (Hilty, Armstrong, et al., 2020), and asynchronous care (Hilty, Torous, et al., 2020). Most of these sets used the ACGME domains (ACGME, 2013) and included suggestions for training, faculty development, and institutional change.Synchronous video is gradually being integrated into clinical care and curricula through seminar, supervision, and rotations in the BH professions (Hilty, Unützer, et al., 2019). A delicate component of this is psychotherapy as part of clinical care and training (i.e., online, e- or otherwise framed; Caldwell, Bischoff, Derrig-Palumbo, & Liebert, 2017; Nelson & Patton, 2016; Pickens, Morris, & Johnson, 2019). Mobile health, social media, and informatics practice require more substantial planning due to clinical decision support, technology selection, and workflow, particularly for families (Wrape & McGinn, 2019; Hilty, Torous, et al., 2020). Clinicians need to plan to review data or be prompted, and then adjust treatment plans “in time” rather than waiting until the next in-person or video visit.The new asynchronous competencies for behavioral health for trainingThis review uses the six ACGME domains (ACGME, 2013), which are Patient Care, Medical Knowledge, System-Based Practice, Professionalism, Practice-Based Learning and Improvement, and Interpersonal and Communication Skills. The authors used subdomain headings applicable across BH professions (Hilty, Maheu, et al., 2018; Maheu et al., 2020), and shifted content to a 3-level learner system (i.e., Beginner, Competent/Proficient and Expert; Hilty, Crawford, et al., 2015) from a variety of levels reported in the literature (ACGME, 2013; Dreyfus & Dreyfus, 1980).The competencies for asynchronous technology (see Table 3),TABLES AND FIGUREStable/figure thumbnailTable 3.

Training subdomains are: Didactic Teaching; Case-based Learning; Clinical Care with Patients; Professionalism, Supervision, and Practice-based Improvement and Learning; Systems-based Practice, Quality Improvement (QI), Evaluation and Research; and Role as an Educator. Systematic curricular planning and evaluation can link patient, learner, and teaching outcomes (i.e., skill, attitude and/or knowledge; Pratt & Collins, 1998; Kern, Thomas, & Hughes, 2009; Kirkpatrick & Kirkpatrick, 2009).Institutional competenciesCompetencies are suggested to integrate video and other technologies: 1) assess readiness; 2) create/hardwire the culture; 3) write policies and procedures; 4) establish the curriculum and competencies; 5) train learners and faculty; and 6) evaluate/manage change (Hilty, Unützer, et al., 2019). For integrating asynchronous technologies, focus areas are: Patient-Centered Care; Evaluation and Outcomes; Roles/Needs of Participants (e.g., Trainees, Faculty, Teams, Professions); Teams, Professions, and Systems Within Institutions; and the Academic Health Center Institutional Structure, Process, and Administration (Hilty, Torous, et al., 2020).DiscussionWhen used to their best capacity, asynchronous technologies improve access, reduce costs, facilitate teamwork, and include family and caregivers via new workflows (Fedele et al., 2017; Hilty, Sunderji, Suo, Chan, & McCarron, 2018; Hilty, Unützer, et al., 2019; Hilty, Torous, et al., 2020; Raney, Bergman, Torous, & Hasselberg, 2017). This supports patient-centered care, participatory medicine, and quality care (Epstein & Hundert, 2002; Frydman, 2009). Clinician competencies and child and adolescent codesign of technologies could improve real-world practice and maximize uptake (Hetrick et al., 2018; Hilty, Chan, et al., 2020; Hilty, Torous, et al., 2020).Technology literacy needs to be validly, reliably, systematically assessed as part of the context of the family’s overall health (Sefton-Green, Marsh, Erstad, & Flewitt, 2016; Terras & Ramsay, 2016). Research is also needed about the psychology of participants’ emergent behaviors and the influential role of context on use. Clinicians and family have significant professional, social, ethical, and legal responsibilities to ensure children and adolescents use technologies safely in this era of digital marketing (e.g., Google Play Store, Apple Store; Wang et al., 2014; Archangeli et al., 2017; Bry et al., 2018; Extremera, Quintana-Orts, Sánchez-Álvarez, & Rey, 2019; Hilty, Torous, et al., 2020; Torous & Roberts, 2017). Faculty supervisors and leaders also have to ensure the delivery of compassionate care with technology (Hilty, Randhawa, et al., 2020; Kemp et al., 2020).Academic organizations face many opportunities and challenges related to clinical care, training, research, and administration (Bowe, Lahey, Kegan, & Armstrong, 2003; Hilty, Liu, Stubbe, & Teshima, 2019). An information technology-business-medicine understanding or framework has been proposed to organize/integrate rather than append information technology to existing systems (Hilty, Uno, Chan, Torous, & Boland, 2019; Hilty, Unützer, et al., 2019; Ray, Muhanna, & Barney, 2007). Institutional competencies and new partnerships with informatics could consolidate missions around competencies (Hilty, Torous, et al., 2020). Organizations may have to emphasize effectiveness, implementation, mixed methods research as much or more than randomized controlled trials (Archangeli et al., 2017; Hilty et al., 2013; Marcolino, Alkmim, Pessoa, Maia, & Cardoso, 2019; Proctor et al., 2011). Mobile health and wearable sensors can help with EMA and EMI in daily life (Odgers & Jensen, 2020; Russell & Gajos, 2020).There are limitations to this article. First, the scoping review process was limited in terms of explicit processes for replicability (e.g., data-charting form to extract data, systematic steps for the analysis phase) and quality of analysis (thematic and numerical; Levac et al., 2010). It could have benefitted from a broader interprofessional team and input across child and adolescent BH organizations. Second, each of the technologies is unique, so greater depth of analysis is needed to determine the “what, when, why and how” they work. Third, institutions differ, and one approach may not fit all. Fourth, this set of competencies must be more clearly defined (i.e., measurable) to implement and evaluate across professions—in conjunction with faculty development and building of a positive e-culture for participants to succeed.ConclusionsAs asynchronous technologies like text, apps, sensors, e-mail, e-consultation, and store-and-forward telehealth are integrated into health care, steps are needed to ensure quality care, clinicians’ skills, and outcomes in line with in-person and synchronous telepsychiatric care. Clinician skillsets (i.e., competencies) for in-person, synchronous and asynchronous technologies overlap, but since the latter has many different components, training could be useful to build a positive e-culture for clinicians, trainees and leaders. Effectiveness and implementation science research—with patient input—is needed to increase the evidence base and usability of mobile health options. 1 | INTRODUCTIONTelemental health, in which mental health care is provided from a distance, encompasses a broad range of practices, including the use of videoconferencing, e-mail, remote monitoring devices, and smartphone applications (Grady et al., 2011; Hailey, Roine, & Ohinmaa, 2008). Telemental health conducted via videoconferencing, referred to hereafter as TMH-V, provides real-time mental health care directly to patients and is rapidly expanding across private and publicly funded health-care systems worldwide (Australian Government Department of Health, 2018; Godleski, Darkins, & Peters, 2012; Lacktman & Rosen, 2017; O'Gorman, Hogenbirk, & Warry, 2015). Psychotherapy, medication management, and assessment services can be delivered via TMH-V to patients located at remote clinics or directly to patients' homes, improving access to care by reducing travel time and costs and providing specialty services to underserved locations (Fletcher et al., 2018; Hubley, Lynch, Schneck, Thomas, & Shore, 2016). TMH-V has shown robust clinical effectiveness in multiple trials, and outcomes were demonstrated as noninferior to in-person care in several studies (Bashshur, Shannon, Bashshur, & Yellowlees, 2016; Hilty et al., 2013; Hubley et al., 2016). Patients have reported high satisfaction with TMH-V overall, describing it as effective and efficient (Kruse et al., 2017).The effectiveness and patient-level acceptance of TMH-V have been well-documented, and there is a growing body of literature examining characteristics of mental health providers using this technology in practice (Glueckauf et al., 2018). However, there has yet to be a systematic review of providers' attitudes toward TMH-V. This represents a critical gap in the literature, given that providers are often the gatekeepers of health-care innovations (Brooks, Turvey, & Augusterfer, 2013; Whitten & Mackert, 2005). If providers do not support the use of TMH-V, uptake may stagnate at the clinic level and patients may be unable to access TMH-V care. TMH-V has the potential to both benefit and inconvenience providers, and these factors may differentially impact providers' attitudes. For example, while TMH-V may make care more efficient and accessible and can increase providers' flexibility, it may also present new challenges with regard to navigating new technologies, coordinating care, scheduling appointments, and developing rapport with patients (Brooks et al., 2013).It is therefore important to examine factors contributing to providers' attitudes toward TMH-V. The unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT; Venkatesh, Morris, Davis, & Davis, 2003) is a comprehensive framework that identifies four primary constructs underlying individuals' acceptance of a technological innovation: performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, and facilitating conditions. Performance expectancy is the extent to which an individual believes that an innovation will be useful and will have a relative advantage over other systems. According to the UTAUT, performance expectancy is the strongest predictor of intention to use a technology. Effort expectancy is defined as the perceived ease of using a given innovation. Social influence refers to perceptions that important people, such as organizational leadership, want the individual to use a new technology, and would view the individual positively for doing so. Facilitating conditions are defined as the perceived level of organizational and technical infrastructure in place to support use of the technology. The UTAUT posits that these four constructs can be moderated to varying extents by user age, gender, and experience using the technology, as well as the degree of voluntariness of adopting the innovation.The current systematic review had three primary aims. The first was to assess the extent to which providers' overall attitudes toward TMH-V were positive or negative. The second aim was to situate these findings within the key constructs outlined in the UTAUT, namely the extent to which TMH-V was found to be useful, easy to use, encouraged by organizational leaders, and supported by necessary infrastructure. The third aim was to examine potential influences of provider age, gender, experience with TMH-V, and voluntariness of use on attitudes toward this innovation.2 | METHODSWe conducted a comprehensive review of the English-language, peer-reviewed literature on providers' attitudes toward TMH-V, published between January 2000 and June 2019 within three databases: PubMed, CINAHL, and Embase. Each subsequent database search filtered out results from the previous databases to prevent duplicates. Our initial search strategy required articles to contain a term pertaining to TMH-V as well as a term referring to providers or attitudes/experiences within their titles and/or abstracts. The complete list of searched terms is as follows (with asterisks indicating that any words beginning with that string of letters were included):TMH-V terms: telemental health, tele-mental health, telepsychiatry, telepsychotherapy, telepsychology, teletherapy, e-therapy, online therapy, online counseling, OR [(telehealth, telemedicine, telecare, video*, communication tech*) AND (psych*, mental*)]Provider terms: provider*, clinician*, psychiatrist*, psychologist*, stakeholder*, nurse*, professional*, physician*, social work*, personnel*Attitude terms: attitude*, perception*, experience*, interest*, opinion*, view*, utilization, satisfactionThe first author screened the titles and abstracts of the articles resulting from this search and identified those appropriate for full-text review. To meet criteria for inclusion with this review, articles were required to include the following:Information regarding providers' attitudes toward or experiences using TMH-V to provide direct, real-time clinical care to patients. Consulting with another provider by videoconference, or the use of alternative technologies such as secure messaging, store and forward communications, or web-based treatment protocols did not qualify.Information from the perspective of the provider who conducted/would be conducting the TMH-V session with the patient versus from a primary care or emergency room doctor requesting a TMH-V consult.Qualitative and/or quantitative data collected using an explicitly identified measure, such as a survey or semi-structured interview. Articles that did not indicate and describe the measure used to collect their data were excluded.At least four providers meeting the above criteria were sampled. Providers could be of varying disciplines. This number was chosen in an attempt to achieve balance between including as many high-quality studies as possible, while also helping ensure that the interpretations of findings were reasonably generalizable to the broader population of mental health providers.2.1 | ReliabilityThe first author identified a subset of 10 articles from within the 86 identified for full-text review, some of which the first author had determined to meet inclusion criteria, others of which were ultimately excluded. These articles were independently scored as eligible or ineligible by co-authors CJM and MSB. Fleiss's kappa for the three raters within this subset of manuscripts was .829, indicating excellent interrater reliability. SLC, CJM, and MSB then met for a consensus meeting in which the inclusion/exclusion of all 86 articles was discussed, guided by a document compiled by SLC including detailed summaries of the articles' study designs, participants, and findings. The group reached consensus on the 38 articles included in the final sample.2.2 | Analytic approachThe following information was reported for each included study: the number, discipline, and extent of TMH-V experience of providers sampled, the type of services provided through TMH-V, characteristics of the patient population, the location at which patients received TMH-V care, the measures used to assess providers' attitudes, and a brief summary of main findings. TMH-V experience was defined as whether or not providers had ever conducted a TMH-V session with a patient. Risk for selection bias, performance bias, detection bias, attrition bias, and selective reporting bias was assessed for all studies according to Cochrane Collaboration guidelines (Higgins & Green, 2011).At the broadest level, it was determined whether providers' overall attitudes toward TMH-V were reported as primarily positive or negative within each study, when that information was available. Each article was then coded for the presence of the four primary UTAUT constructs within provider attitude data: Performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, facilitating conditions, and subconstructs were identified. The frequency with which subconstructs were endorsed, and the percentage of all articles that included each subconstruct were then calculated, and findings were summarized across articles. Next, based on the UTAUT model, the potential moderating role of gender, age, experience, and voluntariness of use was considered within provider attitude data. Articles were coded as to whether they presented findings involving any of these moderators. Experience was the only moderator discussed across multiple articles; these results were summarized across articles. Additional distinctions in providers' attitudes not encompassed in the above sections were then coded and summarized.3 | RESULTSThe initial search strategy resulted in 739 articles. Eighty-six articles were identified as appropriate for full-text review after title and abstract screening (see modified PRISMA diagram, Figure 1).TABLES AND FIGUREStable/figure thumbnailFigure 1.

Summary of articles included in systematic review (N = 38)View larger image > in this page > in new window> Download slideTwenty-eight studies (74%) assessed providers' attitudes toward specific modes of TMH-V treatment, for which the patient population and the location of patients' care were identified; the remaining ten studies (26%) were surveys of providers' attitudes toward TMH-V more generally. Seventeen studies exclusively sampled providers with TMH-V experience (45%), 19 studies included providers both with and without experience (50%), and two studies exclusively sampled providers with no experience (5%). TMH-V was described as having various uses, including providing psychotherapy (22/38, 58%), short-term consultation and assessment (17/38, 45%), and medication management (12/35, 34%). Twenty-eight studies specified the locations at which patients received TMH-V care, including hospitals and clinics (21/28, 75%), within their homes (5/28, 18%), or in other locations, including schools, youth centers, crisis homes, or community centers (4/28, 14%). Fifteen studies involved the treatment of child and adolescent patients (39%), ten included military personnel/veterans (26%), and three included indigenous populations (8%). Eighteen studies (47%) were conducted outside of the United States, including Canada (7/38, 18%), Australia (5/38, 13%), and the United Kingdom (3/38, 8%). One study was conducted in each of the following countries: China, Finland, Italy, and Norway.3.1 | Overall attitudes toward TMH-V3.1.1 | Positive attitudesOverall attitudes toward TMH-V were largely positive (Adler, Pritchett, Kauth, & Nadorff, 2014; Baird, Whitney, & Caedo, 2018; Brooks, Manson, Bair, Dailey, & Shore, 2012; Cunningham, Connors, Lever, & Stephan, 2013; Levy & Strachan, 2013; Mitchell, MacLaren, Morton, & Carachi, 2009; Moreau et al., 2018; Whitten & Kuwahara, 2004; Wynn, Bergvik, Pettersen, & Fossum, 2012), such that providers were satisfied with TMH-V (Interian, King, St. Hill, Robinson, & Damschroder, 2017; Lindsay et al., 2017; Mayworm et al., 2019; Ruskin et al., 2004) and favorable toward its use (Cipolletta & Mocellin, 2018; Moreau et al., 2018), describing it as important (Glover, Williams, Hazlett, & Campbell, 2013; Volpe, Boydell, & Pignatiello, 2013) and an acceptable mode of treatment delivery (Elford et al., 2001, 2000; Thomas et al., 2017). These positive opinions were observed across types of services provided, location of TMH-V care, and patient populations.Providers' positive attitudes most frequently included reference to the UTAUT construct of performance expectancy, with multiple articles describing the innovation as being effective (Jameson, Farmer, Head, Fortney, & Teal, 2011; Perle, Burt, & Higgins, 2014; Starling & Foley, 2006) and useful (Gelber, 2001; Gibson, O'Donnell, Coulson, & Kakepetum-Scghultz, 2011; Glueckauf et al., 2018; Kopel, Nunn, & Dossetor, 2001; Simms, Gibson, & O'Donnell, 2011). One statistical analysis found that providers' perception of usefulness was the most important factor in determining intention to use TMH-V based on questionnaire data (Monthuy-Blanc, Bouchard, Maïano, & Seguin, 2013), consistent with UTAUT hypotheses (Venkatesh et al., 2003). Six subconstructs of performance expectancy were identified (Table 2).TABLES AND FIGUREStable/figure thumbnailTable 2. Positive aspects of TMH-V generated by providersView larger image > in this page > in new window> Download slideThe most commonly endorsed subconstruct was increasing access to care, such as for patients in remote locations, with disabilities or illnesses that made travel difficult, or with child or elder care responsibilities, as well as allowing for care during inclement weather (16/38, 42%; see Table 2 for included studies). The second most frequently endorsed benefit was saving time and money and increasing efficiency of services (12/38, 32%). Multiple articles also shared provider sentiments that TMH-V could have advantages over in-person care in some circumstances, such as by increasing patient comfort and decreasing inhibition when discussing sensitive subjects including trauma (8/38, 21%). Several of these advantages over in-person care were specific to providing TMH-V directly to patients' homes versus to another clinic (Gordon, Wang, & Tune, 2015; Lindsay et al., 2017). These included allowing care to be received discreetly and privately at home, offering a window into a patient's living environment, and serving as a stepping stone into care for avoidant patients. Receiving feedback that patients liked TMH-V was also noted as a positive aspect (6/38, 16%). TMH-V was described as providing increased flexibility, such as by allowing providers to work from different locations or check in more easily with high-risk patients (4/38, 11%). TMH-V was also mentioned as providing new job opportunities for providers, expanding the reach of their work, and facilitating increased collaboration with other clinicians (3/38, 8%).Regarding effort expectancy, multiple articles reported that providers found TMH-V to be easy to use (7/38, 18%). The remaining two constructs were discussed less frequently. In terms of social influence, several articles described the positive impact of supportive leadership on providers' attitudes toward TMH-V (3/38, 8%). Facilitating conditions, such as having strong technical support services, were also mentioned in several articles (4/38, 11%).3.1.2 | Negative attitudesAlthough overall attitudes toward TMH-V were largely positive, there were several exceptions. A minority of psychiatrists (4 of 11) reported being satisfied providing medication management through TMH-V in one study (Wagnild, Leenknecht, & Zauher, 2006). They described technological and scheduling barriers, perceptions of TMH-V as impersonal, and reinforcement of patients' social isolation as drawbacks. Two studies reported difficulty recruiting clinicians to provide TMH-V care (Adler et al., 2014; Shulman, John, & Kane, 2017). Reasons for providers opting to not participate included lack of interest (Adler et al., 2014) and concerns about technological issues (Shulman et al., 2017); both studies noted that perceptions of extra effort and hassle associated with TMH-V were deterrents.Multiple drawbacks to TMH-V use were noted regarding performance expectancy, including articles that reported positive attitudes toward TMH-V overall. Six subconstructs were identified, and the frequency with which they were endorsed is reported in Table 3.TABLES AND FIGUREStable/figure thumbnailTable 3. Negative aspects of TMH-V generated by providersView larger image > in this page > in new window> Download slideConcerns were often raised regarding TMH-V being impersonal or interfering with the therapeutic relationship. Difficulties detecting nonverbal cues such as fidgeting or crying, poor hygiene, or signs of intoxication were noted, along with trouble maintaining eye contact and disruptions to conversation flow (19/38, 50%; see Table 3 for included studies). Safety and legal concerns were common, including the inability to be physically present to assess for risk and coordinate patient transfer to a hospital; some providers questioned their liability in the case of a crisis and the limitations of their licenses, such as whether they could legally see a patient via TMH-V across state lines (13/38, 34%). Some providers felt that patients would not like using the TMH-V modality as compared to in-person visits (8/38, 21%). A lack of provider knowledge regarding TMH-V security and confidentiality was noted in several articles (7/38, 18%). Providers also raised the possibility that certain patients, such as those with hearing or visual impairments, or those who are socially isolated or high risk, would not be appropriate for TMH-V care (5/38, 13%). Finally, some noted an inability to conduct a thorough assessment, including a physical examination, using TMH-V (6/38, 16%).The most frequently endorsed concern fell within the construct of effort expectancy and involved technological problems, including suboptimal audio and video quality, insufficient bandwidth to support videoconferencing, and malfunctions during treatment sessions (23/38, 61%). TMH-V was also often associated with increased workload and hassle due to factors such as equipment setup and additional scheduling processes (16/38, 42%). With respect to social influence, two studies (5%) mentioned the negative impact of having poor communication or support from leadership regarding TMH-V. In terms of facilitating conditions, several articles described a need for technical support and training (9/38, 24%), as well as having limited access to TMH-V equipment, clinic space, and funding (6/38, 16%).3.2 | Attitude variability related to extent of TMH-V experience3.2.1 | Users versus nonusersSeveral studies drew comparisons between users and nonusers of TMH-V within their samples. Compared to those with no experience, users had more positive attitudes toward TMH-V (Adler et al., 2014; Gilmore & Ward-Ciesielski, 2019) and expressed more confidence regarding their ability to provide care through TMH-V (Adler et al., 2014; Austen & McGrath, 2006). Providers with TMH-V experience were less likely to cite drawbacks to use such as staffing and credentialing concerns (Adler et al., 2014) or difficulties operating the technology, managing high-risk patients, or developing a therapeutic alliance (Interian et al., 2017). Predictors of increased use of TMH-V included finding the technology easy to use and having a history of training (Gibson et al., 2011; Glover et al., 2013; Simms et al., 2011) as well as having more years in practice (Gilmore & Ward-Ciesielski, 2019; Simms et al., 2011). A study of psychiatry residents found that those in rural as opposed to urban settings were more likely to plan on using TMH-V after residency (Glover et al., 2013). One study noted that younger age was related to TMH-V use (Gilmore & Ward-Ciesielski, 2019); however, more years in practice was also reported as predictive of TMH-V use, making this finding difficult to interpret given that these variables would likely be negatively correlated.3.2.2 | Preuse versus postuseAlthough relatively few studies assessed providers' attitudes before and after TMH-V use, the majority revealed an increase in positive sentiments with experience. Studies reported increases in positive opinions (Brooks et al., 2012; Whitten & Kuwahara, 2004), interest (Glover et al., 2013), comfort level (Gelber, 2001), and ease of use of the technology (Gibson et al., 2011), as well as decreases in providers' skepticism (Elford et al., 2000) and apprehension (Brooks et al., 2012) following use. Several studies reported that providers were pleasantly surprised after trying TMH-V, noting that it was “much better than I thought it would be” (Elford et al., 2000), and caused less disruption to clinical care (Adler et al., 2014) and rapport development (Lindsay et al., 2017) than anticipated. Multiple studies noted that providers were surprised by their patients' generally positive attitudes toward TMH-V (Adler et al., 2014; Brooks et al., 2012; Kopel et al., 2001; Newman, Bidargaddi, & Schrader, 2016), their willingness to participate, and the speed at which they adapted to this new mode of treatment delivery (Whitten & Kuwahara, 2004). In contrast, one qualitative study noted that two providers characterized TMH-V consultations as “twice as hard” to conduct as in-person sessions because of poor audio and video quality; they described being unable to detect nonverbal cues and needing to use shorter sentences and exaggerated gestures (Starling & Foley, 2006). However, it is worth noting that this study was published in 2006 and that the technology being evaluated is likely not representative of the current quality of TMH-V platforms.Some providers with TMH-V experience noted that the benefits of TMH-V outweighed its various drawbacks and described the development of strategies and workarounds to address barriers encountered during use (Gibson et al., 2011; Lindsay et al., 2017; Simms et al., 2011). These included developing relationships with local law enforcement and hospitals to implement safety protocols in the case of a patient emergency, panning the camera around the provider's treatment room to reassure wary patients that no one else was overhearing their confidential session, or completing the remainder of a session by phone if the video connection unexpectedly failed.3.3 | Additional distinctions in providers' attitudes3.3.1 | Provider satisfaction with TMH-V versus in-person careMost studies comparing providers' opinions toward TMH-V and in-person care found the latter to be more desirable. Providers reported preferring in-person care when completing child assessments and interventions (Elford et al., 2000; Levy & Strachan, 2013), and psychodynamic therapists described TMH-V as being slightly less effective than in-person sessions (Gordon et al., 2015). A minority of psychiatry residents with TMH-V experience felt that TMH-V was equal to face-to-face encounters (34%; 40% noted that it was not equal, and 26% were neutral; Glover et al., 2013). Providers conducted both TMH-V and in-person sessions in four intervention studies included in this review: a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of psychologists completing a cognitive behavioral therapy protocol for bulimia (Ertelt et al., 2011), an RCT of psychiatrists providing medication management and supportive counseling (Ruskin et al., 2004), a non-RCT in which psychologists conducted clinical intake interviews (Schopp, Johnstone, & Merrell, 2000), and a non-RCT in which psychiatrists provided school-based medication management and assessment to children (Mayworm et al., 2019). In-person sessions were rated significantly higher in terms of provider satisfaction (Mayworm et al., 2019; Ruskin et al., 2004; Schopp et al., 2000), as well as providers' perception of goal formation, task completion, and development of a therapeutic bond (Ertelt et al., 2011). Three of these four studies shared that, despite being significantly lower than in-person scores, TMH-V ratings remained high (Ertelt et al., 2011; Mayworm et al., 2019; Ruskin et al., 2004). Several studies reported that providers found TMH-V to be adequate (Kopel et al., 2001), equivalent (Elford et al., 2001), or an acceptable alternative (Elford et al., 2000; Thomas et al., 2017) to in-person sessions, noting that there was “little to no difference” in care (Volpe et al., 2013). It is notable that these studies examined short-term consultation or assessment services delivered via TMH-V versus longer term psychotherapy or medication management.3.3.2 | TMH-V provider satisfaction as compared to patients and referring providersStudies that compared provider and patient attitudes toward TMH-V found patients to be more satisfied than providers on average (Cruz, Krupinski, Lopez, & Weinstein, 2005; Shulman et al., 2017; Thomas et al., 2017). Providers rated working alliance measures as lower for TMH-V versus in-person sessions of a cognitive behavioral therapy protocol, while there were no significant differences in patient-rated scores between modalities (Ertelt et al., 2011). Another study reported that providers found technical difficulties to be more problematic and burdensome than patients; the authors posited that patients were more accustomed to experiencing delays when receiving health care as compared to providers (Schopp et al., 2000). In a study of emergency room providers who requested TMH-V consultation from a psychiatrist or social worker at a remote hospital, the providers requesting the patient consultation were more satisfied with the service than the providers conducting the TMH-V session (Thomas et al., 2017). It was hypothesized that the workflow of those providing TMH-V consultation was impacted more than the workflow of the requesting providers.3.4 | Risk of biasThere is the risk of publication bias within the current review, such that negative or contradictory findings regarding providers' attitudes toward TMH-V may have been omitted from results sections or may have precluded publication of completed research altogether. A risk of selection bias was identified within all included studies. Specifically, it is possible that the providers who opted to complete TMH-V surveys or participate in TMH-V intervention protocols may be categorically different from providers who opted out. Only one study (Shulman et al., 2017) reported the number of providers who elected to participate relative to the total number approached. Performance bias can occur within unblinded studies and refers to the provision of increased attention to the experimental group (i.e., those receiving TMH-V) as compared to the control group, beyond the scope of the actual intervention. Four studies assigned patients to TMH-V or in-person care (Ertelt et al., 2011; Mayworm et al., 2019; Ruskin et al., 2004; Schopp et al., 2000); providers in these studies may have given additional attention to patients in the TMH-V condition given the novelty of this modality, which could have impacted their subsequent perceptions of TMH-V effectiveness. Performance bias was also possible in the multiple other intervention studies without an in-person control condition, as providers may have put more effort into TMH-V sessions conducted within the context of a research study. Detection bias is also inevitable in this context, given that the main outcomes of this review are providers' attitudes toward using TMH-V, preventing any sort of blinding regarding treatment condition when considering outcomes. Attrition bias is a significant concern among the included intervention studies. Only one study (Adler et al., 2014) reported on the observed attrition rate of therapists, with attrition here referring to inability to ultimately provide TMH-V care due to clinic and organization-level barriers. The remaining studies only included providers who participated in the full intervention within their samples, inviting the possibility that providers who ultimately dropped out of the intervention or were unable to provide TMH-V were not accounted for in analyses. Selective reporting bias is also likely given that many included studies did not clearly specify outcomes of interest within their analytic plans.4 | DISCUSSIONThe current systematic review revealed a diverse and growing literature examining providers' attitudes toward TMH-V, and findings were positive overall. TMH-V was described as improving access to care for patients, increasing efficiency of services, saving time and money, and being more effective than in-person care in some circumstances. Additional benefits included TMH-V being easy to use, well-received by patients, supported by organizational leadership, and facilitated by strong training and technical support systems. While few articles reported negative overall attitudes toward TMH-V, many drawbacks to use were mentioned across studies. Technological difficulties were the most common concern and were reported in the majority of articles. Increased hassle and workload were also frequently mentioned. Most studies noted that TMH-V could feel impersonal, interfere with the therapeutic relationship, or impede the detection of nonverbal cues. Some providers reported beliefs that patients would not like TMH-V or that certain patients would not be appropriate to receive care remotely. Safety, security, liability, and confidentiality concerns were noted, as was the difficulty of conducting a thorough assessment via TMH-V. Lack of facilitating conditions, including training and technical support, was also endorsed. Poor support from leadership was a less frequently mentioned contributor to negative attitudes.This finding that overall attitudes toward TMH-V were positive despite the presence of many drawbacks suggests that the relative weights of its benefits and disadvantages are not equal. Specifically, the perceived benefits of increasing efficiency, flexibility, and access to care for patients may offset the relative impersonality of TMH-V as well as its technological difficulties and increased provider burden. This finding aligns with the UTAUT, which posits that the performance expectancy of an innovation is the most significant predictor of its acceptance (Venkatesh et al., 2003).Current findings also suggest a relationship between experience using TMH-V and providers' attitudes. Specifically, providers with experience using TMH-V reported more acceptance of the modality than nonusers. A trend emerged in which providers experienced increases in positive sentiments upon using TMH-V, including being, “pleasantly surprised” by its functionality and ease of use (Adler et al., 2014; Elford et al., 2000; Lindsay et al., 2017). These findings, while tentative, align with UTAUT predictions, such that the perceived effort required to use an innovation declines following experience interacting with and adjusting to the technology (Venkatesh et al., 2003). In keeping with this theory, workflow modifications would become practiced over time and require less hassle on the part of the provider. Furthermore, experienced providers described developing strategies and workarounds to address barriers to use. This suggests that with experience, providers can mitigate some of the negative aspects of TMH-V, contributing to more positive overall attitudes toward the innovation.However, while providers' attitudes toward TMH-V tended to improve with experience, they still generally displayed a preference for conducting appointments in person versus via TMH-V. The exception to this finding involved short-term consultation and assessment procedures, in which TMH-V was deemed largely equivalent to in-person sessions. Therefore, TMH-V satisfaction may vary based on the nature of services being provided. For example, difficulties establishing a therapeutic alliance from behind a screen may have a larger impact within longer term care, in which the alliance develops over time and is an important predictor of therapy success (Martin, Garske, & Davis, 2000), as compared to brief patient interactions that do not involve follow-up. These difficulties may particularly impact psychologists, who may be more likely to have frequent and longer sessions with patients (e.g., weekly evidence-based treatment protocols) as opposed to providers primarily offering brief consultations or periodic medication management appointments. Findings emphasize the importance of optimizing audio and video quality to improve the ability to connect with patients via TMH-V, by increasing detection of subtle nonverbal cues and minimizing audio and video lags that can disrupt conversation flow. Through training, providers can also be made aware of these drawbacks and develop new strategies, for instance adjusting camera placement to ensure proper angles and lighting to best see and be seen by the patient, or maintaining a low threshold to inquire about recent substance use, given the greater difficulty of detecting intoxication remotely (Shore, 2013). That being said, there may be instances in which an in-person appointment is deemed necessary to conduct a thorough assessment (e.g., to measure vital signs if the patient does not have a home monitoring device such as a personal blood pressure cuff). This will likely be a greater barrier to prescribing clinicians or behavioral medicine specialists as opposed to those who do not conduct physical examinations as part of their treatment protocols.Although TMH-V satisfaction levels were high overall, providers reported lower satisfaction than their patients. It is possible that the perceived drawbacks of establishing a therapeutic relationship via TMH-V may be more salient to providers than to patients, as noted in one study in which providers reported lower working alliance scores for TMH-V versus in-person sessions, while patient scores did not differ across modalities (Ertelt et al., 2011). The degree of effort required to use TMH-V also likely contributes to observed discrepancies in satisfaction. TMH-V represents a shift in the care model, such that providers are expected to reach out to their patients, versus their patients being expected to come to their office, a dynamic that redistributes effort expenditures and may in turn affect satisfaction. Indeed, TMH-V is more likely to impose burdens on providers—in terms of undergoing training and integrating new technologies and processes into their preexisting workflows—as compared to patients, for whom TMH-V is intended to decrease the more burdensome aspects of care. Furthermore, patients may be more accustomed to encountering delays and adapting to unfamiliar systems when receiving care as compared to their providers (Schopp et al., 2000).Several aspects of the UTAUT were notably underrepresented within the reviewed articles. Although many articles discussed the moderating role of experience, there was little to no information shared regarding the role of gender, age, and voluntariness of use on providers' acceptance of TMH-V. Future research should aim to examine these factors as they may influence attitudes toward TMH-V adoption. Indeed, findings of demographic differences within the broader mental health technology literature are complex and not consistent across studies (Glueckauf et al., 2018; McMinn, Bearse, Heyne, Smithberger, & Erb, 2011). There was also relatively little information provided regarding social influence from leadership or contextual factors. The role of organizational support can significantly influence providers' attitudes, as discussed within established implementation frameworks (e.g., CFIR; Damschroder et al., 2009). Indeed, one study in the current review emphasized the importance of developing an organization-level “telehealth culture” involving information sharing across providers, policy development, training, and system-wide changes in administrative systems and staffing to ensure successful and sustained uptake of TMH-V (Newman et al., 2016).Developing a TMH-V implementation plan, including formalized education, training, and supervision, as well as the involvement of experienced facilitators, can help to increase provider buy-in, enthusiasm, and confidence navigating this new technology (Fletcher et al., 2018). These strategies will be especially important to consider when moving beyond small-scale trials and toward the widespread integration of TMH-V into general practice. Ideally, successive generations of providers will receive TMH-V education and training as part of their graduate programs, which will increase the ubiquity of these services. However, postgraduate training is necessary to ensure that current providers gain comfort and experience navigating this technology and that these skills are maintained over time as technologies continue to evolve. It is notable that few of the reviewed studies described the nature and extent of TMH-V education and training received by providers. Future studies should prioritize examination of these factors and their influence on providers' attitudes toward TMH-V.Limitations to the current conclusions must be noted, particularly regarding the observed relationship between attitudes toward TMH-V and experience. Importantly, there is no way to determine the causality of provider sentiments; for instance, providers with more positive a priori opinions toward TMH-V or who experienced fewer barriers to use may have been more likely to ultimately use TMH-V. Alternatively, use of TMH-V may have subsequently increased providers' positive opinions. Similarly, selection bias may exist in study designs; for instance, providers with more positive attitudes toward TMH-V may have been more likely to participate in the included studies, while providers who were unable to integrate TMH-V into their practice, who discontinued TMH-V use, or who had negative attitudes overall may not be adequately represented. In addition, many articles did not distinguish between providers with or without TMH-V experience when describing attitudes toward use. This represents a significant limitation as the potential moderating role of experience could not be examined, such as whether there was variation in the number or type of drawbacks endorsed by these groups. Furthermore, measures of providers' attitudes and satisfaction with TMH-V were highly variable across studies as there is no “gold standard” measurement of these constructs, which prevents direct comparison of findings and limits overall interpretations. Additional limitations include the omission of non-English-language publications and the small sample sizes of some of the included studies. Indeed, the experience of implementing and using TMH-V within a small trial may be very different from attempts to integrate TMH-V into larger and more complex settings. Although a consensus approach was used to determine article inclusion, the systematic review analyses were conducted by the first author and did not involve additional formal consensus procedures, which could be considered a limitation. However, all co-authors provided critical feedback regarding the analytic plan and presentation of current findings. Finally, 12 of the included studies were published over 10 years ago, and given the time taken to conduct and publish research, many of the more recent studies are likely also referring to technologies that are now somewhat outdated. Given the fast-moving pace of innovation, it is possible that some of the drawbacks discussed in this review may be specific to older TMH-V equipment and processes that have since been refined. This in turn limits the potential generalizability of these findings to current conditions and emphasizes the need for ongoing review of the literature as TMH-V technology continues to evolve and improve.Although the current review focused on TMH-V, it is important to note that additional technologies may fall within the domain of telemental health, including e-mail, smartphone apps, message boards, or web-based therapy protocols. Two of the studies included in the current review surveyed providers' attitudes toward telemental health technologies more broadly, with only TMH-V results reported here (Cipolletta & Mocellin, 2018; Glueckauf et al., 2018). Future work should aim to synthesize findings from papers that evaluate multiple forms of telemental health concurrently, in order to examine variation in provider attitudes based on mental health technology type. Future studies should also examine whether there may be discipline-level variability in providers' attitudes toward TMH-V that may relate to differences in typical encounter characteristics; for instance, whether prescribing clinicians with less frequent and shorter appointments with their patients may have more positive views toward TMH-V than psychologists with longer and more frequent sessions.The finding that providers' positivity toward TMH-V may have outweighed various barriers to use could have important implications when attempting to implement this technology in practice. If providers believe that using TMH-V will improve overall access to care and ultimately increase efficiency and flexibility, they may be more willing to accept initial increases in hassle and disruptions in workflow, as well as an altered quality of connection with patients. This distinction is important to consider when introducing TMH-V to providers, specifically preparing providers for the inevitable growing pains of adopting this new technology, but emphasizing the net benefits that TMH-V may provide to their patients and themselves with sustained use.The balance between perceived benefits and drawbacks of TMH-V among providers is also likely to continually shift in response to rapid advances occurring in the field. Improvements in the quality of communication via TMH-V, due to strengthened broadband connectivity and increasingly sophisticated video and audio technologies, may help to lessen the relative disadvantages of connecting with a patient from behind a screen (Brooks et al., 2013). With continued use and troubleshooting, TMH-V will ideally become more seamlessly integrated into electronic health record, scheduling, and billing platforms, which would relieve a substantial amount of staff burden. In addition, the introduction of legislation allowing for the wider provision of telehealth, such as a recently enacted bill allowing TMH-V to occur across state lines within the Veterans Health Administration, as well as similar legislation within the Department of Defense, will decrease logistical barriers to care (Brooks et al., 2013; U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, 2018; Zur, 2019). State laws requiring insurers to reimburse TMH-V appointments to the same extent as in-person care (i.e., parity laws) will also be critical in increasing uptake, as will the relaxation of mandates in some states requiring out-of-state providers to obtain special licenses to provide telehealth services (Adler-Milstein, Kvedar, & Bates, 2014). In fact, a Psychology Interjurisdictional Compact (PSYPACT), which would provide a streamlined certification process for psychologists to conduct TMH-V across state lines, is currently in development (Wicklund, 2019b); similar compacts have already taken effect for physicians and nurses across multiple states (Wicklund, 2019a). The development and dissemination of established clinical competencies and guidelines for care will also likely help to standardize TMH-V practices and increase provider confidence (Hilty, Maheu, Drude, & Hertlein, 2018; Shore et al., 2018). Furthermore, providers' comfort interacting with patients via TMH-V may continue to increase as videoconferencing becomes ubiquitous across multiple domains, from coordinating remote work meetings to connecting with family members using smartphone video chat features.It is also worth noting that many of the most unique strengths of TMH-V involve providing services directly to patients' homes versus to remote clinics—for instance allowing immobile and severely ill patients to receive care, providing a window into a patients' living environment, and serving as a stepping stone into services for avoidant or highly anxious patients (Fletcher et al., 2018; Gordon et al., 2015; Lindsay et al., 2017). Advancements in technology, including improved wireless connectivity and facilitated access to smartphones and tablets, will allow more TMH-V to take place within patients' homes, which may further increase the relative advantages of this modality. Only five of the included studies in this review delivered TMH-V to patients' homes, and four of those studies were published in the past three years, highlighting the relative novelty of this modality and the need for additional research to understand possible effects of TMH-V delivery location (e.g., clinic or home) on provider and patient perceptions as well as clinical outcomes.Yet importantly, current findings reveal that providers prefer in-person contact when given the choice. It therefore remains likely that regardless of future advancements in technology, in-person contact will continue to be preferred by many providers and patients when it is easily accessible. As such, TMH-V can be viewed as one of many effective treatment modalities whose relative advantage will vary depending on the unique circumstances of each clinical contact. For some patients with significant barriers to receiving in-person care, TMH-V technology may represent the first and only way in which they are able to undergo therapy. Even if a provider may generally prefer in-person appointments when given the choice, the benefit of providing therapy via TMH-V to a patient who otherwise would receive none is clear. A hybrid model of care may be ideal in other cases, such that patients receive a combination of in-person and TMH-V sessions based on changing needs over the course of therapy (Yellowlees & Nafiz, 2010). These hybrid care structures will likely become more common as TMH-V uptake increases, and their use and effectiveness should be studied.In sum, the current review revealed that providers' attitudes toward TMH-V are positive overall, despite the acknowledgment of multiple drawbacks to its use. This finding suggests that the relative advantages of TMH-V in certain circumstances, such as increasing access to care where services are limited, may outweigh its various disadvantages from the provider perspective. Gaining experience conducting TMH-V sessions with patients may lessen perceived drawbacks of use and foster the development of strategies and workarounds to improve care delivery. As health-care systems increasingly prioritize TMH-V, it will be crucial to consider providers' attitudes and perspectives when working to facilitate uptake, as they will play a key role in the successful implementation of this innovation. Exposure to potentially traumatic events (e.g., physical abuse, sexual abuse, witnessing domestic or community violence, violent or unexpected death of a loved one) is a significant public health concern with approximately half of all youth reporting experiencing at least one type of potentially traumatic event before the age of 18 (Finkelhor, Turner, Shattuck, & Hamby, 2013; Kilpatrick et al., 2003). Trauma exposure increases the risk of a number of mental health problems and disorders including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, anxiety disorders, externalizing problems, and substance use disorders (Kessler, 2000). Despite high rates of trauma exposure and subsequent mental health outcomes, many children in need of mental health care still do not receive it, receive an inadequate “dose” of sessions, or do not receive evidence-based care (Alegría, Vallas, & Pumariega, 2010; Comer & Barlow, 2014). Even greater health disparities are seen across geographies (e.g., rural locations) and among racial and ethnic minority youth (Merikangas et al., 2011; “New Freedom Commission,” 2007).Telepsychotherapy Can Extend the Reach of Evidence-Based TreatmentTelepsychotherapy (also referred to as telemental health or telehealth), offers an innovative way to address significant gaps in access to care. Telepsychotherapy refers to the use of interactive, real-time (synchronous) technologies, such as videoconferencing, to deliver psychotherapy to patients (Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, 2019). Secure videoconferencing technology allows providers and youth/families at different locations to interact in real time. It is a relatively low-cost technology solution because mental health interventions largely rely on conversation rather than the need for the expensive peripheral devices (e.g., electronic otoscope or stethoscope) that are used in some telemedicine applications. Additionally, youth often have extensive exposure to and comfort with technology, including videoconference software, and thus, telepsychotherapy may be a particularly good fit for this age group (Nelson, Cain, & Sharp, 2017).Telepsychotherapy has the potential to address several barriers in the accessibility of evidence-based care. First, telepsychotherapy can overcome distance and time barriers to treatment and minimize conflicts with job and child care responsibilities (Comer, Elkins, Chan, & Jones, 2014). For example, telepsychotherapy reduces travel time and thus can decrease interference with caregiver work schedules and missed school time for patients. In addition to the distance and time barriers, patients and families also report that they utilize telepsychotherapy to decrease costs associated with traveling long distances for care and to decrease stigma by connecting to child friendly locations such as schools (Gloff, LeNoue, Novins, & Myers, 2015).Current evidence provides some support that services delivered via telehealth are efficacious in addressing a number of disorders in youth such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (Myers, Vander Stoep, Zhou, McCarty, & Katon, 2015), obsessive–compulsive disorder (Comer, Furr, Kerns, et al., 2017), disruptive and oppositional behavior (Comer et al., 2015), depression (Nelson, Barnard, & Cain, 2003), PTSD (Stewart, Orengo-Aguayo, Cohen, Mannarino, & de Arellano, 2017), and other mental health problems (see Gloff et al., 2015, for a review). Comprehensive reviews of child telehealth have found good clinical outcomes in both rural and urban settings (e.g., Cain, Nelson, & Myers, 2015; Gloff et al., 2015; Nelson & Sharp, 2016), with high rates of diagnostic accuracy, practical feasibility of methods employed, and satisfaction across patients and caregivers (Hilty et al., 2016; Myers, Palmer, & Geyer, 2011).Delivery of Trauma-Focused Treatment for Children and Adolescents via TelepsychotherapyAlthough the published literature supporting telepsychotherapy delivery of evidence-based treatments for children is expanding, there is still a dearth of literature evaluating trauma-focused treatment for children delivered via telepsychotherapy. To our knowledge, there is only one small proof of concept feasibility study (Stewart, Orengo-Aguayo, Cohen, et al., 2017) and several case studies demonstrating feasibility and preliminary evidence of symptom reduction (Jones et al., 2014; Stewart, Orengo-Aguayo, Wallace, Metzger, & Rheingold, 2019; Stewart, Orengo-Aguayo, Gilmore, & de Arellano, 2017). Additional community-based studies are needed to establish feasibility and effectiveness of a telepsychotherapy service delivery model for childhood posttraumatic stress treatment in real world environments. This has become even more salient in the midst of the COVID-19 global pandemic of 2020, which has forced mental health providers (and many other health care professions) to transition to a telehealth service delivery modality in the interest of public safety.Trauma-focused cognitive–behavioral therapy (TF-CBT; Cohen, Mannarino, & Deblinger, 2017) is an evidence-based treatment for trauma-exposed youth that has garnered robust empirical support. Over 21 randomized trials have demonstrated support for its efficacy in improving PTSD symptoms across a variety of service settings in both the United States and globally (Cohen et al., 2017, pp. 74–80; de Arellano et al., 2014). TF-CBT is ideal for disseminating and testing via a telehealth model of delivery as a means to reduce barriers in access to evidence-based, trauma-focused treatment.Present StudyIn 2015, our team developed the Telehealth Outreach Program (TOP) to deliver evidence-based, trauma-focused care to children and adolescents living in seven diverse communities across South Carolina. This effort involved ongoing program evaluation data regarding TF-CBT delivered to children via telepsychotherapy sessions conducted at either their schools or homes. This included measurement of practical feasibility variables (reflected in the number of sessions attended and rates of treatment completion), as well as pre–post comparison of clinically relevant treatment outcome variables (captured via standardized, psychometrically sound self-reports and structured clinical interviews). The methods for data extraction and aggregation entailed closed chart review of patients who received services through the TOP clinic (which received institutional review board approval). This article complies with the American Psychological Association’s (2020) Journal Article Reporting Standards.MethodParticipants and ContextParticipants were 70 children and adolescents aged 7 to 18 who were referred to a major medical center in South Carolina. The sample had a mean age of 12.73 years (SD = 3.34) with the following demographic distribution: 81.4% female, 58.6% Hispanic, 30.0% African American, and 11.4% Caucasian. A total of 42.9% of youth had an index trauma of either sexual (n = 24) or physical (n = 6) abuse; 21.4% (n = 15) experienced the traumatic loss of a loved one; 18.6% (n = 13) witnessed domestic or community violence; 8.6% (n = 6) experienced or witnessed armed robbery; and 8.6% (n = 6) had other index traumas such as traumatic medical procedures, car accidents, and so forth. Fifty-six percent of youth also endorsed experiencing additional secondary traumas. All children met criteria for PTSD (n = 60), adjustment disorder (n = 9), or other specified trauma and stressor related disorder (n = 1) according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (5th ed; DSM–5; American Psychiatric Association, 2013) at the time of treatment initiation, assessed via a structured clinical interview and self-report assessments at intake. Patient barriers to traditional treatment access included lack of transportation, child caregiver work schedule, lack of childcare, residence in a rural area with limited access to treatment providers, and/or need for services to be conducted in Spanish. With regard to the latter, 34.3% of children (n = 24) and 57.1% of parents (n = 40) requested Spanish-language materials and services.To overcome these barriers, patients received remote services either at school or home, in Spanish or English, as part of an ongoing telehealth program development project. TOP was initially funded as a pilot project in 2015 through a Duke Endowment Grant and subsequently funded through the South Carolina Telehealth Alliance and a Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration National Child Traumatic Stress Network grant. The program currently provides trauma-focused treatment for youth in seven underserved communities across South Carolina. The program receives referrals from schools, child advocacy centers, law enforcement agencies, mental health clinics, and other community agencies and provides assessment, TF-CBT treatment, and psychiatric medication management services as needed.Broader inclusionary criteria for the current study were as follows: (a) patient age between 7 and 18 years; (b) at least one remembered/reported trauma on the University of California at Los Angeles PTSD Reaction Index (UCLA-PTSD-RI; Kaplow et al., 2020; Steinberg, Brymer, Decker, & Pynoos, 2004); (c) significant experience of posttraumatic stress, defined by self-report of at least three current symptoms of PTSD according to DSM–5 criteria; (d) presence of a caregiver who could participate in treatment as needed; (e) experience of at least one barrier to accessing traditional office-based treatment (e.g., rural location, caregiver work schedule, limited English proficiency); and (f) caregiver consent and child assent. Exclusionary criteria were (a) current significant suicidal ideation, (b) serious child externalizing behaviors that would endanger themselves or the telehealth equipment, or (c) under the age of 7. To expand on the latter, the therapist needed be able to view the child at all times via the web camera for safety reasons and children had to have attentional capacity sufficient to engage in a continuous 60 min of web-based interaction within this constraint. The research team colloquially found both of these criteria to be difficult with children younger than 7 (thus the rationale for a minimum age that was somewhat older than previous randomized TF-CBT trials that included much younger children).MeasuresUCLA-PTSD-RI (Kaplow et al., 2020; Steinberg et al., 2004)The UCLA-PTSD-RI assesses trauma exposure and posttraumatic stress symptoms corresponding to DSM criteria in youth between the ages of 7 and 18. Parent-, child-, and adolescent-report versions of the instrument are available, all of which comprise 17 items capturing respondent experience of PTSD symptoms. The instrument yields a total scale score, as well as subscale scores for reexperiencing, avoidance, and hyperarousal. Total scores range from 0 to 68, with higher scores representing more severe posttraumatic symptoms. The instrument has demonstrated good internal reliability in multiple studies, with Cronbach’s alphas between 0.90 and 0.96 (Kaplow et al., 2020; Roussos et al., 2005; Steinberg et al., 2013). Cutoff scores of 38 (DSM–IV version; Steinberg et al., 2004) and 35 (DSM–5; Kaplow et al., 2020) have been previously established as reflective of a likely diagnosis of PTSD. The instrument can be administered as either a self-report or clinician interview, the latter of which was the format used with youth and caregivers in the current study.Two additional notes about the use of the instrument in the current study are warranted. First, it was administered in Spanish to anyone (children or caregivers) whose stated preference was to communicate in that language. This translated version of the instrument is as yet unpublished but was obtained from the original author through a personal communication (Steinberg, May 9, 2017). As outlined in this communication, an extensive translation process was conducted that included forward translation from English to Spanish followed by back-translation and item-level refinement of any notable discrepancies. Second, two versions of the instrument were used, which corresponded to DSM–IV criteria for the first 50 patients and DSM–5 criteria for the last 20. Although the content changes between versions were minimal, scores on different versions of the measure were not directly comparable and adjustments to data analysis and presentation had to be made (see below).Short Mood Feeling Questionnaire (SMFQ; Angold et al., 1995)The SMFQ is a 13-item instrument to measure child and adolescent depression, comprising the 13 highest-loading items from the Mood Feeling Questionnaire–Long Form (Angold et al., 1995; Costello & Angold, 1988). Previous psychometric studies have exhibited good internal consistency of the measure (α = .85; Angold et al., 1995). Parent- and child-report versions of the instrument are available, and a score of 8 or higher on either form is indicative of likely depression. The original author was contacted to inquire about a Spanish translation of the instrument, which was reportedly developed across multiple organizations using a process very similar to that described above. As with the UCLA-PTSD-RI, the Spanish-language version of the instrument was administered to anyone with a stated preference for such (children or their parents).TreatmentTrauma-focused cognitive–behavioral therapyTF-CBT (Cohen et al., 2017) is an evidence-based, manualized treatment protocol used to treat posttraumatic stress symptoms in children and adolescents ages 3–18. TF-CBT is usually delivered in 12–24 weekly sessions and includes the following components: (a) psychoeducation, (b) parenting skills, (c) relaxation skills, (d) affective modulation skills, (e) cognitive processing skills, (f) trauma narration and processing, (g) in vivo mastery of trauma reminders, (h) conjoint child–parent sessions, and (i) enhancing safety or future development. Efficacy for TF-CBT has been established through numerous randomized controlled trials in a range of populations (Cohen et al., 2017).Treatment was provided by one of the following: (a) a licensed clinical psychologist (the first author), (b) a postdoctoral fellow with a doctoral degree in clinical psychology, (c) a clinical psychology intern with a master’s degree in clinical psychology, or (d) a licensed master’s-level social worker. Both doctoral-level therapists and three of six interns were bilingual in English and Spanish and capable of conducting services in either language. All study personnel received initial TF-CBT training from a licensed clinical psychologist who is a national trainer in TF-CBT, as well as weekly clinical supervision from a licensed clinical psychologist with expertise in TF-CBT.Telepsychotherapy connectionsThe clinical program examined was developed and refined according to the American Telemedicine Association’s and American Psychological Association’s current practice guidelines for telemental health, as well as published accounts of other technological, ethical, and administrative considerations (e.g., American Psychological Association, 2013; Myers et al., 2017; Shore et al., 2018). The hardware demands for rendering services were minimal, consisting on the therapist side of a desktop computer, web-camera, external speakers or a headset, and a microphone. For participants, hardware setups differed depending upon location, but requirements were similarly minimal. Participants receiving sessions at school connected using a laptop computer and headset device provided by the research team. Those receiving sessions at home had an array of connection options that depended upon their existing resources. When and where families had computers and access to sufficiently high-speed Internet, they could participate in home-based sessions using their own equipment. When families did not have access, however, the program provided them with an iPad (with the capability for cellular data transmission if needed), headset, and white noise machine for use to facilitate treatment. Software was selected to be similarly minimal in terms of learning demands and resources necessary to connect to treatment providers. Although many options for video communication are available, the current project entailed use of Vidyo (Vidyo Inc., 2010). Vidyo is videoconferencing software that conforms to Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act and Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health requirements and allows two-way, real-time communication in a low bandwidth environment. It also enables the capability for screen-sharing, which facilitates immediate display of handouts or other written materials with patients (Comer et al., 2014).ProcedureAssessmentParticipants referred for treatment initially engaged in a comprehensive clinical evaluation that included separate clinical interviews with child and caregiver(s), elicitation of trauma, medical, and psychiatric history, and completion of self-report instruments described above. These assessments were conducted either through telehealth or in-person meetings depending upon patient needs and logistical considerations for study-staff deployment. Preference for location of subsequent telepsychotherapy services was also discerned at this meeting, and eligible youths were scheduled to participate either at school or home. Self-report measures were repeated before beginning the trauma narration and processing component of treatment, which was an individually based and variably timed determination based on all available clinical data. The same clinical interview administered at baseline was repeated at the end of treatment, as were all self-reports. Participants did not receive compensation to complete assessments.TreatmentPrior to the first treatment session all participants (and their schools, when relevant) received assistance from staff in setting up the Vidyo software and testing their connections. This test entailed technical assessment of bandwidth and user interface viability as well as a tutorial from the study staff about Vidyo’s basic functions. Additionally, schools and/or families were given basic guidelines for the physical environment in which treatment should ideally occur, including selection of an isolated, quiet space that would ensure privacy, deactivation of cell phones or other alerts from electronic devices, and minimization of other distraction opportunities (e.g., other people; TV; using the computer/iPad for other purposes during sessions). Once treatment parameters were established, participants presented for approximately weekly telepsychotherapy TF-CBT sessions with academic medical center therapists (located between 30 and 150 miles away). Special considerations for the format of treatment included ensuring that all individuals present announced themselves, backup plans were made to conduct sessions by phone in the event of an Internet outage or technical malfunction, and specific procedures to handle potential safety issues remotely (adult present and available at all times in case of an emergency; 911 or police called if child was in imminent risk and could not be deescalated or kept safe).Patient and caregiver engagementCaregiver participation is an important component of TF-CBT, but also a simultaneously challenging issue in child mental health treatment in terms of effectively engaging caregivers, particularly in a school-based environment. (Gopalan et al., 2010). Our program utilized evidence-based strategies to enhance engagement through addressing logistical, perceptual, and cultural barriers to treatment engagement (Gopalan et al., 2010; McKay & Bannon, 2004). These strategies involved using reminder phone calls and text messages, directly addressing caregiver concerns and barriers at the time of the initial appointment and throughout treatment, and addressing beliefs and attitudes related to mental health treatment (particularly those likely to present barriers to receiving services).For the present study, 81% of youth (n = 57) had a caregiver who actively participated in treatment on a regular basis (i.e., attended treatment sessions weekly or biweekly). During each session, the therapist typically met individually with the child and then met conjointly with the child and caregiver or individually with child and caregiver at separate times for caregivers who were unable to attend sessions at their child’s school. For home-based telepsychotherapy cases (n = 24), the therapist was able to meet with the caregiver in the home via telehealth at the time of the session with the youth. For school-based telepsychotherapy cases (n = 46), caregivers could be scheduled to meet with the therapist at the school location. Alternatively, if the caregiver was unable to attend telepsychotherapy sessions at the child’s school, the child was seen at school via telepsychotherapy and the parent component was completed via computer or iPad at some other point (e.g., after the parent returned home from work or during the parent’s lunch break).Interactive electronic-format activities for delivering treatment content and promoting engagementTF-CBT is structured to make significant use of worksheets and visual aids to facilitate therapy being more interactive and engaging for children and adolescents. To implement these same strategies via telepsychotherapy a variety of techniques were implemented, including the development of electronic versions or treatment worksheets and handouts and the use of PowerPoint presentations and digital games. For example, worksheets and handouts designed for in-person therapeutic engagement were adapted to allow the therapist to use the “screen-share” function of the videoconferencing platform that allows real-time sharing of the therapist’s desktop view. We also created a series of interactive computer games that children play in session with their therapist to enhance the child’s understanding of treatment concepts. These programs allow both the therapist and patient to simultaneously see a working document in real-time during session; however, only the therapist was able to manipulate the documents and thus the child had to instruct the therapist which moves to make for him/her during the game. We used Microsoft PowerPoint, Word, and Excel and Adobe Acrobat to create our working documents and interactive games, thus making them portable and freely accessible to most environments (given the ubiquity of these software applications in professional settings).The majority of activities and games used in our telepsychotherapy program were adaptations of in-person clinic-based TF-CBT treatment activities, but others were new games created specifically for the purpose of telepsychotherapy sessions. One activity adapted from in-person TF-CBT treatment activities is the “How Do We Experience Feelings in Our Bodies?” activity (Hendricks, Cohen, Mannarino, & Deblinger, n.d.), which aims to help children review physiological responses to emotions. In clinic-based, in-person care, the therapist uses a worksheet that asks the child to indicate where in his or her body he or she feels specific emotions and then collaborates with the child to color in the worksheet. For the telepsychotherapy delivery format, we developed an interactive PDF document that provides children with an image of the worksheet, which they can color in with the assistance of the therapist by continually verbally communicating to direct the therapist as to where to color.An example of an interactive game we developed using PowerPoint (called “Feelings Memories”) reinforces emotion vocabulary in connection to real-life experiences. The child selects a tile numbered 1–12. Behind each numbered card are an emotion term and the instruction, “Tell me about a time when you felt (sad, mad, happy, scared, etc.).” The therapist and child take turns selecting a card and telling about a time when they felt the identified emotion. Other interactive games we developed are Jeopardy-style games presented via PowerPoint, which therapists use to review psychoeducation regarding sexual abuse, physical abuse, witnessing domestic violence, or traumatic grief, depending on the specific traumatic events each child had experienced.Other examples of telepsychotherapy-specific strategies include the use of interactive worksheets, PowerPoint presentations with content tailored to the child’s interests, video clips, and electronic versions of children’s books. For example, we utilized PowerPoint to create an animated activity for teaching about varying levels of emotions. This animation shows a thermometer with the temperature rising as emotions intensify. Additionally, we frequently used video clips. For example, when teaching about diaphragmatic breathing with a child who liked soccer, we used a video clip of a soccer player utilizing diaphragmatic breathing before a penalty kick. We also incorporated additional strategies while completing the trauma narrative. For example, a child dictated the trauma narrative while the clinician typed verbatim what the child says into a Word document. The therapist was able to “share” the therapist’s screen with the child so that he or she could see the words that the therapist was typing in real-time. Additionally, children colored pictures with crayons and paper to illustrate specific elements of the traumatic event, which could be displayed to the camera and captured by the clinician through a screenshot (and later used in the child’s trauma narrative, if applicable). Similarly, therapists could also work collaboratively with the child to create a PowerPoint version of the trauma narrative incorporating clipart or other picture-based methods of conveying their experiences.ResultsProcess Description and Qualitative Results: FeasibilityStrategies for providing TF-CBT via telepsychotherapyA primary concern in delivering TF-CBT via telepsychotherapy was patient safety. To address this concern, pretreatment site visits to schools were used to survey the physical premises and build relationships that would later serve to facilitate good communication between the treating clinicians and the school staff (e.g., guidance counselor). During each session of TF-CBT, clinicians had contact information readily available for school staff. All appointments took place during regular school hours of operations; accordingly, the school staff was available in case of emergencies. Notably, there were only two instances in which school staff needed to be contacted, and no instances in which local authorities needed to be contacted due to patient safety concerns. In both instances schools were contacted due to patient suicidal ideation. Additionally, in school-based sessions there was one instance in which a teenager inappropriately disengaged from the therapeutic communication (i.e., closed the laptop during the therapy session), which was quickly reconnected with a call to the identified school contact (guidance counselor). There was also one instance of a patient leaving her chair and crouching on the floor out of view of the camera, wherein the clinician successfully requested that the patient return to the chair.For home-based telepsychotherapy, a caregiver was always present in the home at the time of sessions. During each home-based session, clinicians had contact information available for the caregiver who was present in the home as well as additional emergency contacts for the child. Additionally, an emergency plan was discussed with each family that involved contacting local police or 911 if the clinician thought that the child or caregiver presented an imminent threat to themselves or others. No safety concerns arose during home-based TF-CBT telepsychotherapy sessions.Technical performance of the telepsychotherapy equipmentThere were few technical problems with the telepsychotherapy equipment. Occasionally, school sites and home-based patients experienced initial difficulty with logging into the videoconferencing software. This led to a delay in starting sessions; however, this issue was always easily resolved via telephone calls with the treating clinician. Additionally, the telepsychotherapy video feed occasionally became pixilated for several seconds when using a Wi-Fi-based Internet connection, but this was resolved by utilizing a direct Ethernet connection. More difficulty was encountered when utilizing cellular data-enabled iPads in rural locations. In several cases the video feed frequently became pixilated or froze and the sound and/or video were lost. These issues were often resolved by having the patient move to a different location with a better signal (provided that location was private). In one case the cellular data connection was too poor to adequately provide home-based treatment and thus the child was transitioned to school-based sessions. In general, though, the telepsychotherapy equipment worked adequately for its intended purpose and rarely necessitated accessing backup telephone procedures. The provision of simple, standardized troubleshooting guides and step-by-step, written reminders of instructions for accessing video connections likely also helped facilitate reduction of errors.Quantitative ResultsInitial comparison of groupsDemographics, baseline symptoms levels, and number of sessions completed were investigated across the two main treatment settings (school and patient home, excluding the two participants who received services in both). As expected, Mann–Whitney tests revealed no group differences in gender (p = .61), race (p = .88), or language preference (p = .78 and 0.53 for child and parent, respectively). Similarly, t tests comparing baseline measures revealed no differences in patient age (p = .55) or baseline symptom levels on the UCLA-PTSD-RI (p = .80 for child; p = .11 for parent) and SMFQ (p = .92 for child; p = .71 for parent) comparing school and home treatment settings. Additionally, neither group differed in terms of the number of sessions completed over the course of the study (p = .88). Given the lack of significant differences as a function of treatment setting, all analyses that follow were conducted considering the entire sample as a whole (see Table 1TABLES AND FIGUREStable/figure thumbnailTable 1. Outcome ScoresView larger image > in this page > in new window> Download slidefor summary data).Service provisionSchool-based telepsychotherapy services were provided to 44 youth and home-based for another 24. Two additional youth began treatment in the school-based setting but later transitioned to home-based sessions after moving schools and no longer having availability of adequate resources at school. Assessment and treatment were provided in English or Spanish according to the stated preference of participants. Services were provided in English for 46 youth and Spanish for 24, whereas caregivers received Spanish-language sessions in 40 cases and English in 30.Clinical outcomesAt baseline, 51.4% of children (n = 36) scored above the relevant clinical cutoff on the UCLA-PTSD-RI (accounting for the version of the scale implemented). By the completion of treatment, however, only 4.3% scored above clinical cutoffs (n = 3). A similar trend was noted in parent report on the UCLA-PTSD-RI, wherein 28.5% (n = 20) indicated clinical elevation at baseline but none did by the end of treatment. Examination of mean scores for both versions of the instrument are given at pre-, mid-, and posttreatment in Table 1. Comparisons of pre- and posttreatment child-reported scores indicated significant differences on both the DSM–IV, t(40) = 14.12; p < .0001; d = 2.42 and DSM–5 versions, t(17) = 8.90; p < .0001; d = 2.04. Findings comparing parent-reported data were similar, DSM–IV, t(36) = 9.19; p < .0001; d = 1.68; DSM–5, t(16) = 6.09; p < .0001; d = 1.50.As can be seen in Table 1, baseline child and parent reports on the SMFQ indicated mean levels that were above the established clinical cutoff score. By the completion of treatment, however, these scores had decreased precipitously such that average symptom levels were no longer problematic. Comparing baseline to posttreatment scores for children, t(57) = 9.27; p < .0001; d = 1.24, and parents, t(51) = 6.34; p < .0001; d = 1.21, indicated that this difference was statistically significant in both cases. The aforementioned variables were also compared in a series of 2 (Group; school or home) × 2 (Time; pre- or posttreatment) analyses of variance. These results were nonsignificant (all values between 0.37 and 0.81), indicating that within-group changes were consistent regardless of the setting in which treatment occurred.As outlined above, all participants met criteria at baseline for a trauma- or adjustment-related disorder, with 60 of 70 participants having a primary diagnosis of PTSD. By the end of treatment 54 participants (77.1%) were diagnosis-free and another seven (10.0%) retained primary diagnoses that were not related to trauma. Only two cases continued to meet criteria for PTSD by the endpoint assessment, and both evidenced substantial changes in self-reported posttraumatic symptoms on the UCLA-PTSD-RI (decrease from 72 to 42 for one participant and 46 to 26 for the other).DiscussionThe world is currently undergoing an unprecedented global pandemic with COVID-19 that has highlighted the pressing need for evidence-based telehealth service delivery models of mental health services. Stress is increased for many caregivers and children due to things such as social isolation and economic instability. There is the potential for increase in PTSD and other stress-related disorders in children, particularly children of caregivers at elevated risk for exposure, including health care providers, first responders, grocery store and sanitation workers, and so forth. The present open pilot trial of TF-CBT offers one of the first evaluations of the use of telepsychotherapy to remotely deliver TF-CBT in community-based locations, and findings supported the preliminary feasibility and effectiveness of this novel treatment delivery format with trauma-exposed children and adolescents. The present findings add to a growing body of literature supporting telepsychotherapy for expanding the reach of evidence-based mental health treatments for youth (e.g., Comer, Furr, Kerns, et al., 2017; Comer, Furr, Miguel, et al., 2017; Cooper-Vince, Chou, Furr, Puliafico, & Comer, 2016; Doss, Feinberg, Rothman, Roddy, & Comer, 2017; Gloff et al., 2015; Nelson et al., 2003; Sibley, Comer, & Gonzalez, 2017). Although recent research has supported the efficacy of telepsychotherapy delivery of a variety of interventions for children, the literature has focused very little on childhood PTSD. The preliminary feasibility and positive treatment outcome of telepsychotherapy-delivered TF-CBT observed in this pilot evaluation are promising. Close to nine out of every 10 youth (88.6%) completed a full course of telehealth delivered TF-CBT, and 96.8% of these treatment completers no longer met diagnostic criteria for a trauma-related disorder at posttreatment. Although 2.9% (or two individuals) did not exhibit full treatment response, both youths showed substantial treatment response in the form of symptom reduction (albeit not to the extent of full diagnostic remission). Although this pilot evaluation was, by design, underpowered and not methodologically geared to test formal efficacy (see Gallo, Comer, & Barlow, 2013; Kraemer, Mintz, Noda, Tinklenberg, & Yesavage, 2006), there was nonetheless preliminary indication that TF-CBT delivered via telepsychotherapy yielded a favorable clinical response from both youth and caregiver perspectives.Although the present pilot study did not include a comparison condition in which youth were treated in a clinic-based setting, the findings are promising in showing treatment effects that are comparable with TF-CBT delivered in an in-person, office-based setting (Rubin, Washburn, & Schieszler, 2017). Considering that attrition from office-based TF-CBT treatment remains a significant concern (e.g., approximately 25–50%; Cohen, Mannarino, & Iyengar, 2011; Olfson et al., 2009; Scheeringa, Weems, Cohen, Amaya-Jackson, & Guthrie, 2011), the rate of 11.4% for the current study is encouraging. Reduction in barriers to accessing care that the use of telepsychotherapy technology affords (e.g., reduced need for caregivers to take time off from work; find transportation/gas money to reach our clinic; drive long distances to appointments), as well as the availability of linguistically competent clinicians, may have contributed to the high treatment completion rates and the concomitant reductions in clinical symptoms. In particular, it is important to note that our program also utilized additional engagement strategies (Gopalan et al., 2010; McKay & Bannon, 2004), such as using reminder phone calls and text messages, directly addressing caregiver concerns and barriers at the time of the initial appointment and throughout treatment, and addressing beliefs and attitudes related to mental health treatment. These engagement strategies may have decreased treatment attrition beyond what would be seen if we had used the telepsychotherapy delivery model without these additional engagement strategies. While the lack of treatment attrition in the present study is very encouraging, future controlled studies will be needed to directly compare attrition rates for the telepsychotherapy versus in-person treatment modalities.Additionally, future studies investigating the sustainability of telepsychotherapy models are important to further development of this modality of treatment. This becomes an especially important aspect of future research given the global pandemic outbreak of COVID-19 and subsequent rapid adjustment to most mental health services now being offered through telepsychotherapy connections (whether or not providers, agencies, or service delivery systems were ready to do so). For example, individual states are increasingly mandating coverage for telepsychotherapy (American Telemedicine Association, 2017; Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, 2019) and third-party payers are improving reimbursement for real-time telehealth services (American Medical Association, 2019; Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, 2018; Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, 2020b). The recent COVID-19 pandemic has also resulted in temporary federal mandates for Medicare to reimburse telepsychotherapy services offered by psychologists and other mental health providers without regard for previous restrictions regarding rural locations (Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, 2020b). Additionally, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has temporarily relaxed Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act compliance regulations for virtual platform use in an effort to increase the reach of services during this global crisis (U.S. Department of Health & Human Services, 2020). Psychiatric services (e.g., medication management) provided via telehealth were significantly more likely to be reimbursed prior to the COVID-19 pandemic than psychotherapies (e.g., TF-CBT) delivered via telehealth, particularly by federal and state programs (American Telemedicine Association, 2017; Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, 2020a), partially due to their greater ease of integration into primary care or other approved originating environments previously necessary to adhere to CMS rules. The steps taken to increase reimbursement for telepsychotherapy services during the current global pandemic may be the first step in paving the way for sustainability of these services in the future. Further work to establish the effectiveness of delivering trauma-focused treatment for youth through telepsychotherapy could promote sustainability of these interventions that can help to reduce the burden of suffering for families who are underserved by typical office-based models of care (Kazdin & Blasé, 2011).The present pilot study provides preliminary evidence of the ability to successfully deliver TF-CBT via telepsychotherapy technology, resulting in clinically meaningful symptom change posttreatment with low treatment attrition (11.4% dropout) among trauma-exposed children and adolescents ages 7–18. Additionally, the ethnic and language diversity of the sample (58.6% Hispanic, 30.0% African American; 34.3% of children and 57.1% of parents requesting Spanish-language materials and services) provide important preliminary evidence of TF-CBT effectiveness with a more representative sample of trauma-exposed youth in the United States, which may have applicability to other global settings (e.g., Central and Latin America). Nevertheless, additional efforts are still needed to further establish the empirical base for telepsychotherapy delivery of trauma-focused treatment for youth.Limitations of the present study include the small sample size and primarily female sample, which may reduce the generalizability of the study results. The lack of a comparison group and randomization are also problematic in terms predicting the applicability of results in other environments, which would suggest the need for noninferiority studies similar to those seen among adult veteran populations (e.g., Acierno et al., 2016). Treatment fidelity was also only informally assessed during weekly supervision, but more formal measures would have been useful. Additionally, TOP was potentially somewhat atypical in that the program was able to provide iPads and Internet access to patients who would otherwise not have been able to access these resources (thus precluding their participation in treatment). Cost-effectiveness analysis and careful attention to resource acquisition would be useful to examine the feasibility of this strategy in future work in usual care settings. Organizations will need to think creatively to address these barriers, such as obtaining grant or other funding to provide these resources for needy families, as some school districts are doing currently for schooling in the midst of national quarantine restrictions on school attendance.Despite these limitations, program evaluation of applied service delivery environments are critical for pilot testing novel treatment formats that may be useful in supporting future randomized inquiries (Gallo et al., 2013; Kraemer et al., 2006). The present findings are among the first to provide evidence in support of the preliminary feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness of telehealth TF-CBT for youth presenting with trauma-related disorders (i.e., PTSD, adjustment disorder, other specified trauma and stressor related disorder). The COVID-19 global pandemic has resulted in an unprecedented need to rethink how mental health services are delivered, which is particularly applicable to high base rate conditions related to posttraumatic stress. In an effort to protect the public, thousands of mental health providers and patients have been advised to transition to a telepsychotherapy delivery format. Telepsychotherapy offers many benefits over traditional face-to-face psychotherapy service delivery models including (a) reduction of barriers in access to care (e.g., distance to clinic, lack of transportation, cost of gas and parking, work schedules, childcare), (b) increased likelihood of adequate treatment dose and completion (by way of reducing the aforementioned barriers), and, more recently, (c) protecting the public amid a global crisis that requires physical distancing and potentially relative social isolation. Having started this clinic five years ago, our team was well suited to assist teams across the United States and the world in transitioning their own services to a telepsychotherapy format, which was fortuitous as the need to do so arose for essentially the entire field at once. We have now trained providers across child advocacy centers, academic medical centers, university clinics, and independent practice environments. Given the existing network of nationally certified TF-CBT therapists (https://tfcbt.org), and many international TF-CBT therapists, these findings suggest the potential for providing effective and accessible telepsychotherapy intervention during this public health crisis (as well as those that will occur in the future). It will be imperative to present empirical evidence for the feasibility and potential effectiveness of delivering psychotherapy for children and adolescents via telepsychotherapy to legislators and policymakers to ensure sustained reimbursement and expansion of this method. If the COVID-19 pandemic has taught us anything about health care service delivery thus far, it is that the entire American system was ill prepared to adapt to such a crisis. Future work to develop new clinical and technical infrastructures, public policies, and methods of reimbursement is imperative to ensuring that this crisis results in an opportunity to improve service delivery to those in need. Stress is common in agricultural occupations. With the use of heavy machinery and dangerous tools, farming is one of the most hazardous occupations (Freeman, Schwab, & Jiang, 2008). Physical health may be compromised through the use of pesticides and other chemicals, resulting in acute or chronic effects on the nervous, respiratory, immune, endocrine, and/or reproductive systems (Blair, Ritz, Wesseling, & Beane Freeman, 2015). In addition to physical stressors, farm-related tasks, external factors, and interpersonal stressors increase the vulnerability of farmers to mental health concerns (Lunner Kolstrup et al., 2013; Onwuameze, Paradiso, Peek-Asa, Donham, & Rautiainen, 2013). Farm-related tasks include long days, isolation, heavy workload, technological innovation, business management, and farm administration. External factors, such as disease outbreaks, natural disasters, government regulations, climate changes, and market fluctuations, are unpredictable. Finally, interpersonal stressors related to family roles (e.g., family caregiving, conflict, divorce, and spouse’s employment off the farm) have the potential to increase stress (Hovey & Seligman, 2006). With the risk of injury and exposure to chemicals, combined with family pressures and long hours, farmers and ranchers may have a higher risk of developing mental health illnesses (Fraser et al., 2005).The impact of stress on the mental health of farmers is a growing concern. Prevalence rates of depression in agricultural workers in the Midwest have varied from 7.4% to 24% (Onwuameze et al., 2013). Farming is an occupation with a higher suicide rate than the general population (Behere & Bhise, 2009), and gender differences exist, as rural men evidence higher suicide rates than rural women in most countries (Sauvaget et al., 2009). In addition to poor mental health outcomes, farmers have an increased prevalence of chronic health conditions, including cardiovascular and respiratory disease, arthritis, and skin cancer (Kirkhorn & Schenker, 2002).Exacerbating farmers’ mental health concerns is the reluctance to seeking treatment. Farmers are hesitant to acknowledge struggles with mental health, and a negative stigma exists regarding seeking mental health treatment (Judd et al., 2006). Additionally, farm families may live in isolated geographic locations in which seeking mental health treatment is not possible, as rural communities are limited in the availability of mental health services (Gray, 2011). Because of a lack of mental health providers, rural residents tend to receive medication instead of psychotherapy (Richardson, Lewis, Casey-Goldstein, McCauley, & Katon, 2007).Social Support as a Protective FactorSocial support increases overall health and well-being (Berkman, Glass, Brissette, & Seeman, 2000; Cohen, 2004) by serving as a buffer against the adverse effects of work demands (Logstein, 2016). Social support also serves as a protective factor against psychological distress (Caxaj, 2016; Compton, Thompson, & Kaslow, 2005; Turvey, Stromquist, Kelly, Zwerling, & Merchant, 2002); however, limited studies have examined social support as a protective factor in the development of depressive symptoms in farmers (Turvey et al., 2002). In a sample of 99 male Australian farmers, social support and a sense of belonging decreased the relationship between depressive symptoms and suicidal ideations (McLaren & Challis, 2009). Turvey et al. (2002) found similar results with a sample of rural individuals, in which lack of frequent contact with family, friends, or groups was strongly associated with suicidal ideations.Social networks involve a social structure in which individuals engage in close personal relationships and interactions. The quality of social support offered by social networks is important to consider, as individuals with low quality of relationships may have more than double the risk of depression (Teo, Choi, & Valenstein, 2013). In addition to the quality of relationships, different sources of social support may be more beneficial than others when protecting against mental health symptoms (Smith et al., 2013). For example, trust is an important factor in determining with whom farmers will share personal matters (Roy, Tremblay, & Robertson, 2014). Farmers tend to rely upon family members, other farmers, and friends for support with mental health issues rather than professionals (Judd et al., 2006).The majority of the research on the mental health of farmers, including suicide risk, has occurred in Australia (Scheyett, Bayakly, & Whitaker, 2019). Little knowledge exists regarding social support as a protective factor in the development of depressive symptoms in farmers and the types of social support (significant other, family, friend) that would most benefit farmers in the United States. To fill this gap, the current study addressed two research questions: (a) What is the relationship between depression and social support in U.S. farmers?; and (b) Do different types of social support relate to depression in this group?MethodFarmers completed an online survey that included demographic questions and two measures: the Major Depression Inventory (MDI; Olsen, Jensen, Noerholm, Martiny, & Bech, 2003) and the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS; Zimet, Dahlem, Zimet, & Farley, 1988). Demographic information obtained included gender, age, marital status, number of children, race/ethnicity, military status, state of residence, length of time in occupation, and type of operation. Farmers were also asked to specify who they would reach out to if they were faced with a challenging situation (e.g., family, friend, medical provider, pastor/priest, counselor).Participants and ProcedureThe land-grant university Cooperative Extension System provides outreach services for communities across each state. Cooperative Extension personnel throughout one Midwestern state distributed information regarding the online survey through multiple methods, including e-mail distribution lists to producers and direct interactions at farming events during the summer and winter months. Farmers were required to be over the age of 18 and engage in farming or ranching at least part time to qualify for participation in the study. A $10.00 gift card incentive was provided to participants who completed the survey. The study’s protocol was reviewed and approved by all relevant institutional review boards.MeasuresThe MDI (Olsen et al., 2003) is a 12-item self-report questionnaire intended to measure the presence of major depression according to the algorithm of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 4th edition; DSM-IV (American Psychiatric Association, 1994) and the severity of depressive symptoms, with a range of 0 to 50. The instrument inquires about depressive symptoms during the past 2 weeks and uses a Likert scale from 0 (at no time) to 5 (all the time). The MDI has adequate internal validity as a unidimensional scale, and when used as an index of diagnostic validity, has a sensitivity of 82% for DSM–IV major depression (Olsen et al., 2003). The internal consistency in the current sample was very high (α = .91).The MSPSS (Zimet et al., 1988) is a brief 12-item self-report measure that assesses perceived social support from three subscales: Family, Friends, and Significant Other. The items are scored on a 7-point Likert scale, ranging from 1 (very strongly disagree) to 7 (very strongly agree; Zimet et al., 1988). The MSPSS has demonstrated strong factorial validity and internal consistency reliability across varying groups (Canty-Mitchell & Zimet, 2000; Stanley, Beck, & Zebb, 1998; Zimet, Powell, Farley, Werkman, & Berkoff, 1990), and has strong factorial validity confirming the three subscales (Zimet et al., 1990). The internal consistency in the current sample was high for overall social support (α = .97) as well as the Significant Other (α = .95), Family (α = .94), and Friend subscales (α = .96). Overall, the MSPSS is widely used to measure perceived sources of social support (Osman, Lamis, Freedenthal, Gutierrez, & McNaughton-Cassill, 2014).Statistical AnalysisMean MDI and MSPSS scores were compared between men and women using an independent-samples t test, with α = .05. Due to the skewed distribution of MDI scores, a square root transformation was applied to MDI scores prior to analysis. Using bivariate linear regression, each predictor variable was initially screened for significance against MDI score. All variables that reached significance at α = .1 were then tested in a multivariate model. The initial multivariate model included military service, gender, Significant Other subscale, Family subscale, and Friend subscale. Variables that did not remain significant in the multivariate model were removed individually. Once all variables in the model were significant at α = .05, the variables that were previously removed were tested in the final model. Variance inflation factors (VIFs) were calculated for each model, and a cutoff of 5 was used with these models due to the potential for multicollinearity among support scales. However, all VIFs were below 4 and therefore did not meet the threshold of 5 that we had set for multicollinearity. Moderating effects of gender and military service on the social support subscales were tested using Gender × Subscale and Military Service × Subscale interactions. Final data are reported as beta coefficients and p values derived from square-root-transformed outcome variables.ResultsDemographic CharacteristicsParticipants were 172 farmers and ranchers from five Midwestern states (106 men, 65 women; one did not report their gender). Slightly more than half of participants were in middle adulthood, as 26.3% (n = 45) were between 45 and 54 years of age, and 24% (n = 41) were between 55 and 64 years of age. The majority of participants were married (n = 152, 88.4%), and 61.3% (n = 103) had children who helped on the farm or ranch. Most (n = 123, 71.5%) reported a secondary source of income off the farm, whereas 28.5% (n = 49) reported that farming or ranching was their primary source of income, with no income off of the farm.Participants specified to whom they would reach out to if faced with a challenging situation. Most of the farmers would turn to a family member (n = 150, 87.2%) or a friend (n = 118, 68.6%) for support. A little over one third of farmers (n = 62, 36.0%) would seek out a pastor, and 19.8% (n = 34) would talk to a doctor. Only 21 farmers (12.2%) reported that they would seek support from a counselor.Risk Factors for DepressionAccording to the MDI, a score between 20 to 24 indicates mild depression, a score of 25 to 29 indicates moderate depression, and a score of 30 or more indicates severe depression. Most farmers reported a score below 20 (n = 157; 91.3%), whereas 8.7% (n = 15) had scores that were in a depression range. Nine farmers scored between 20 to 24 for mild depression, three scored between 25 to 29 for moderate depression, and three reported a score greater than or equal to 30 for severe depression. There were no significant differences in the depression scores for men and women.On the MSPSS, a mean score from 1 to 2.9 indicates low support, 3 to 5 suggests medium support, and 5.1 to 7 is considered high support. Over 76.2% of farmers and ranchers (n = 131) reported high support from significant others, 74.4% (n = 128) reported high support from family members, and 68.6% (n = 118) reported high support from friends. Overall, no significant differences existed between men and women on the subscales or total mean score for social support.Higher scores on the MSPSS subscales and the total score were all associated with lower MDI scores. In the final model, the Friend subscale (β = 0.22, p = .02) remained significant, and the Family subscale indicated a trend toward significance (β = 0.17, p = .08). There were no significant Gender × Support interaction effects on MDI scores for significant other (p = .97), family (p = .75), and friend (p = .97). Similarly, there were no significant Military Service × Support interaction effects on MDI scores for significant other (p = .97), family (p = .97), and friend (p = .90).

Although the MDI was not used to make a clinical diagnosis, the results suggested a similar prevalence of depressive symptoms as other recent studies, in which estimates have ranged from 7.4% to 24% in Midwestern farmers (Onwuameze et al., 2013). Additionally, only 21 farmers reported a willingness to seek counseling services if struggling with a mental health concern. Farmers may tend to ignore both physical and mental health symptoms unless their work productivity is reduced (Hull, Fennell, Vallury, Jones, & Dollman, 2017). Reluctance to seeking treatment from a mental health provider may also demonstrate the pervasive mental health stigma within agriculture, lower mental health literacy, and the lack of accessibility of mental health services in rural areas. Common structural barriers to mental health care that have been reported include a shortage of mental health providers in rural areas (Fuller, Edwards, Martinez, Edwards, & Reid, 2004) and long waiting times for services (Sturm & Sherbourne, 2001).To increase services to rural farmers, telemental health, which involves providing mental health assessment and treatment remotely, can increase access to efficacious treatments (Hilty et al., 2013). Telemental health has been found to be effective for diagnosis and assessments in adults (Hilty et al., 2013); however, more research is needed to determine the willingness of farmers to access telemental health services and the effectiveness of the care. In addition to increasing access to mental health care, mental health clinicians may also improve communication with farmers by receiving training on the context of farm life to acquire a greater understanding of the physical stressors, farm-related tasks, external factors, and interpersonal stressors farmers experience daily (Hull et al., 2017).Farmers completed the MSPSS to measure perceived social support in three areas: family, friends, and significant other. Low social support scores on the MSPSS in the subscales as well as the total mean score were significantly related to higher depression scores on the MDI, which indicates that as social support decreases, depressive symptoms increase. Furthermore, low support from friends and family appeared to be the most significant risk factors for higher depression scores after controlling for age, gender, military service, and significant-other support.Social support is one of the most essential functions provided by a family (Gardner & Cutrona, 2004). Family relationships within a farming context can be complex, as farming is a unique occupation in which work and home life are intertwined. Often, farming involves multiple generations living in close proximity to one another (Swisher, Elder, Lorenz, & Conger, 1998). Although this closeness offers opportunities for social support, blurred boundaries within roles, tasks, responsibilities, and expectations may exist, resulting in lack of communication and increased conflict among family members (Fraser et al., 2005).Passing ownership of the farm from one family member to the next is one of the most pertinent issues that can create role confusion and conflict. Patrilineal inheritance is a common strategy for keeping the farm within the family (Macken-Walsh & Byrne, 2015). This strategy can be crucial for the economic performance and sustainability of the farm (Cush & Macken-Walsh, 2016). However, farmers tend to retire at a later age (Franklin, Mitchell, Driscoll, & Fragar, 2001), resulting in the male heirs becoming dependent on their parents for a longer duration than nonfarming peers. When passing ownership of the family farm is delayed, the younger generation often struggles with identity issues due to a desire to be autonomous (Fraser et al., 2005). The identity issues and role confusion may contribute to conflict and a disconnection within the parent–child relationship, possibly resulting in lower levels of perceived social support by either family member.In addition to blurred boundaries with family roles and expectations, family communication patterns can influence the method in which one seeks social support. By observing interactions among family members, communication patterns are learned and applied within relationships (Koerner & Cvancara, 2002). Communication patterns related to seeking social support can be direct or indirect. Direct support seeking involves an explicit desire and request for help, including discussing problems and/or feelings while openly displaying one’s emotions (Barbee & Cunningham, 1995). Conversely, indirect support seeking involves minimizing feelings or issues, avoiding specific topics, and trying to hide distress (Goldsmith, 1995). Indirect requests for social support may result in a lack of awareness by the receiver that support is desired. As a result, the receiver is perceived as unaccepting of the request for help. Indirect support seeking, such as lack of openness and topic avoidance, has been associated with less satisfaction and increased distress in relationships (Sargent, 2002). Because of the limited empirical work on help-seeking perceptions and behaviors among farmers (Roy et al., 2014), future research may explore the communication patterns (direct or indirect) for seeking social support within farm families.Communication patterns are also important when establishing and sustaining friendships. Farmers with low friend support may lack the resources to initiate relationships or connect with friends. Strong interpersonal skills are important when establishing networks of social support. Individuals with strong communication skills tend to report increased feelings of happiness and higher levels of self-esteem (Demir, Jaafar, Bilyk, & Mohd Ariff, 2012). Conversely, individuals with poor social skills are at a higher risk of developing psychological distress, because they lack the protective effects of social support (Segrin, McNelis, & Swiatkowski, 2016). Perhaps the farmers who lack social support may be limited in the interpersonal skills necessary to initiate and maintain relationships, which contributes to symptoms of depression. Future research may explore the interpersonal communication styles of farmers and how those styles relate to developing social relationships.Finally, agrarian beliefs influence communication styles and help-seeking behaviors in farm families. The agrarian way of life typically involves pride, physical strength, heavy labor, ruggedness, and self-sacrifice (Bryant & Garnham, 2015). Societal norms on masculinity, such as the avoidance of showing emotion and/or vulnerability, the importance of autonomy, and the ability to take risks contribute to negative attitudes and beliefs toward seeking help from others (Hogan, Scarr, Lockie, Chant, & Alston, 2012). With the social norms of rural masculinity, seeking help may be viewed as unmanly (Roy et al., 2014), which may hinder farmers from discussing and responding to emotional concerns with friends or family members. The lack of openness to discuss problems may limit the opportunities to seek and receive social support.LimitationsBecause the current study used self-report measures, a response bias may have been present. Social desirability refers to the tendency to report symptoms in a favorable manner to gain social approval (King & Bruner, 2000). This tendency is more likely to occur with questions that are socially sensitive, such as mental health questionnaires or interviews (King & Bruner, 2000; Phillips & Clancy, 1970). The depression rate in the current sample was similar to reported rates in the literature; however, symptoms may have been underreported. A social desirability scale may be helpful in future surveys to control for this form of response bias.Farmers were recruited to participate in the study via Cooperative Extension e-mail list serves and farming events, which may limit the generalizability of the results. Considering that Cooperative Extension personnel shared the survey with farmers, the level of perceived social support may have been higher due to an affiliation with Cooperative Extension programming. Additionally, because the current study did not utilize random sampling procedures, representation of the larger farming population may not have been achieved. Future studies employing random sampling procedures would strengthen the methodology by eliminating sampling bias and ensuring the sample represents the target population. Finally, the study used a cross-sectional design and, as such, no cause–effect inferences can be made.ImplicationsThe current study contributes to a greater understanding of the role of social support as a protective factor on depressive symptoms in farmers in the United States. The results highlight the importance of friend and family support and the need to explore family dynamics (e.g., roles, rules, boundaries, expectations) and communication patterns unique to farm families that may contribute to resiliency and protect against depressive symptoms. Additionally, efforts to increase mental health literacy may reduce stigma and improve help-seeking behaviors.Considering farmers tend to disclose to individuals they trust, it is important for mental health providers to understand the context of farming and the stressors that occur within the occupation. By attending training or professional development opportunities, mental health professionals would acquire a better understanding of farm stress that could enhance rapport. Additionally, due to time constraints in farming and the structural barriers related to accessing mental health care in rural areas, traditional face-to-face counseling may not be practical. Telemental health may provide an alternative approach to reaching farmers who are live in remote locations. Couples and families experience relationship and family distress at an alarming rate, with up to one third of couples reporting distress at a given time, and nearly 40% of marriages in the United States ending in divorce (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2015; Whisman, Beach, & Snyder, 2008). Relationship distress is associated with increased risk of mental and physical health problems, including depression, anxiety, substance use, and cardiovascular and immune diseases (Robles, Slatcher, Trombello, & McGinn, 2014). Despite the prevalence and negative impact of relationship distress, few couples seek professional help for relationship problems. In lieu of couple therapy, the majority of couples turn to self-help books or relationship workshops (Stewart, Bradford, Higginbotham, & Skogrand, 2016), and those who do seek couple therapy most frequently do so with a religious leader or organization (Doss, Rhoades, Stanley, & Markman, 2009). Moreover, nearly one in five children and adolescents experience mental illness, with the most common diagnoses being disruptive behavior disorders, mood disorders, anxiety disorders, and developmental disorders (Olfson, Blanco, Wang, Laje, & Correll, 2014). Despite the prevalence of childhood problems, geographic barriers to care, mental health stigma, and lack of financial resources prevent many from seeking and/or accessing help (Mukolo, Heflinger, & Wallston, 2010).Technology Can Be Leveraged to Increase the Reach of Services for Couples and FamiliesTechnological advances provide tremendous opportunities for couple and family services to overcome common barriers to treatment seeking and improve cost effectiveness.Reduced BarriersFirst, technology can be harnessed to overcome logistical barriers and provide unfettered access to services at the pace, schedule, and preference of the client. The most commonly discussed benefit of technology use in psychological interventions is its potential to transcend the confines of geography (Nelson & Bui, 2010) and extend the reach of psychological services (Comer & Barlow, 2014). The majority of mental health services are concentrated in major metropolitan regions and academic hubs. As a result, a sizable proportion of United States countries—especially rural and remote communities—do not have a mental health provider specializing in youth, family, or relationship interventions (National Organization of State Offices of Rural Health, 2011). In contrast, 77% of adults in the United States own a smartphone and 73% have broadband access at home; in rural areas of the United States, the comparable numbers are 67% and 63%, respectively (Smith, 2017).Improved Cost EffectivenessFinancial burdens associated with mental health care often reduce or prevent access to mental health treatment (Sareen et al., 2007). Financial barriers are especially acute for treatments of relationship or family distress because insurance companies often do not reimburse for couple therapy or family interventions not focused on a child’s diagnosis. Technology can seemingly be used to overcome these financial barriers, although the issue has received scant empirical attention. For clients, technology can reduce transportation, parking, and childcare costs that are often associated with clinic-based treatment (Smit et al., 2006). Technology may also reduce costs for providers, as brick-and-mortar therapy rooms are not required. Moreover, most of the costs of automated or asynchronous applications are incurred up front, with little added costs associated with each additional couple or family served (e.g., Georgia, Rothman, Roddy, & Doss, 2017).Importance of Technology for Family and Couple InterventionsIntegration of technology into interventions may be particularly useful for the unique needs and circumstances of couples and families. First, couple and family interventions come with unique barriers to access to care. Treatment involving multiple participants requires coordination of multiple schedules and costs associated with multiple people missing work or school. Couple and family treatment also requires engagement of more clients with different priorities or goals. Unfortunately, unwillingness of family members to attend therapy sessions contributes to nonengagement in therapy (Wang et al., 2006).Second, technology can reduce the stigma of face-to-face family and couple interventions—especially among men and children. Stigma significantly predicts likelihood of seeking mental health services, with higher self-stigma associated with fewer services sought (Lannin, Vogel, Brenner, Abraham, & Heath, 2016). Men are more likely than women to be reluctant about entering in-person couple therapy (Doss, Atkins, & Christensen, 2003). Moreover, children who are less willing to participate in in-person treatments show poorer treatment outcomes (Karver, Handelsman, Fields, & Bickman, 2006).Types of Technologically-Supported InterventionsIn broad strokes, the application of technology to enhance, supplement, or replace in-person mental health interventions can be grouped into two categories: telemental health interventions and behavioral intervention technologies (BITs). Telemental health interventions refer to services that leverage videoconferencing media platforms to facilitate real-time interactions for the provision of mental health care that is traditionally delivered in person (American Telemedicine Association, 2017). BITs include applications of technology that are used to augment in-person treatments (e.g., an app to remind clients of homework assignments or track thoughts/behaviors) or provide self-help interventions without formal in-person treatment (e.g., an online program, with or without coach support). As these applications of technology differ in important ways, we cover each separately in this paper. For both telemental health and BITs, we will present recommendations for design and implementation, recruitment, and evaluation of these technologies. Throughout, we will draw from an extensive body of research that has been conducted on applications of technology for individual disorders (e.g., Marsch, Lord, & Dallery, 2014) and, where available, from the couple and family literature.Telemental Health InterventionsThe key distinguishing feature of telemental health is the use of synchronous interactive telecommunication technologies to enable providers to remotely deliver real-time services. However, telemental health interventions can additionally incorporate asynchronous store-and-forward communications between clients and providers (as well as related BITs). Across health care disciplines, mental health care may be particularly amenable to videoconferencing-based delivery, given that mental health care relies heavily on both verbal and nonverbal communication. Videoconferencing platforms now afford very high quality, simultaneous, two-way audio and video transmissions. Accordingly, clinical interest in telemental health interventions for children, couples, and families, as well as focused research evaluating the potential of such programs, have sharply increased in recent years (e.g., Comer, Furr, Kerns, et al., 2017; Comer, Furr, Miguel, et al., 2017; Myers, Vander Stoep, Zhou, McCarty, & Katon, 2015; Vander Stoep et al., 2017). For example, Internet-delivered parent-child interaction therapy (I-PCIT; Comer et al., 2015) uses videoconferencing to deliver parent training to families in their own homes; the family uses a webcam to stream family interactions to a therapist who remotely coaches parents through a parent-worn Bluetooth earpiece. Delivering treatment in consumers’ own homes or natural settings increases the ecological validity of interventions for couples and families. For example, in parent training, having the child in his or her typical setting may increase the chances that the child responds in typical ways, providing more representative challenges for the parent and therapist to work through, and facilitating direct opportunities for generalization of treatment gains. Indeed, a recent randomized controlled evaluation found a significantly higher rate of excellent responders among families treated with I-PCIT relative to families treated with clinic-based PCIT (Comer, Furr, Miguel, et al., 2017).How Does One Design and Implement a Telemental Health Intervention?Matters of security, confidentiality, comfort, engagement, and reimbursement are critical to consider when designing and implementing telemental health couple and family interventions.Videoconferencing platformsVideoconference platforms can be lumped into two main categories: standards-based or consumer-grade applications. Standards-based videoconferencing systems involve point-to-point transmission, using an application that is installed on the computer of both the provider and the client. Standards-based point-to-point applications allow for firewalls, encrypted communication, and, in general, a highly secure interface. In general, nothing offers higher quality and security than T-1 and T-3 line connections, which provide point-to-point transmissions that do not go over the public Internet. However, T-1 and T-3 line connections, and related standards-based systems, are very expensive and can require considerable maintenance. As such, standards-based systems can be cost prohibitive for many providers and health care systems, particularly when telemental health interventions are delivered from one site to multiple locations (e.g., individual client homes) rather than to a single site (e.g., one primary care office in a rural community). More affordable and practical consumer-grade alternatives transmit communications over the public Internet from one Internet protocol (IP) address to another, albeit with relatively slower speeds and somewhat reduced security. Many consumer-grade videoconferencing platforms (e.g., VSee) also offer screen-sharing features that allow providers and clients to easily exchange images, progress graphs, or questionnaires, or to remotely collaborate on documents, in real time.When using a consumer-grade videoconferencing platform, it is critical that the provider confirm that any videoconferencing platform selected: (a) does not store or retain any session information on its network after sessions are complete, (b) allows users to host meetings that are unlisted and requires the host to invite all attendees, (c) requires identification of all meeting attendants, (d) requires all meeting attendants use a strong password to log in, (e) requires approval of “Forgot Password” requests, and (f) uses the advanced encryption standards or comparable algorithm and a secure encryption tunnel (see Chou, Comer, Turvey, Karr, & Spargo, 2016 for further discussion). While several such consumer-grade platforms are available, VSee is a leading provider this is relatively affordable and easy to use.When selecting appropriate videoconferencing software, the most affordable options are free services, such as Skype, but such platforms offer somewhat poorer audio and video quality than other options (e.g., more disrupted or dropped calls), and importantly they often store and retain meeting data, which raises concerns about privacy and confidentiality. As such, we do not recommend free videoconferencing services, such as Skype, for delivery of telemental health services. Additionally, we recommend that providers and clients use password-protected computing devices (rather than mobile devices) and utilize Ethernet cords (not wireless connections).HardwareAt a minimum, couple and family telemental health interventions typically require a computing device with online connectivity, webcam, and microphone at both the provider site and at the client site. Most modern-day computing devices include built-in cameras and microphones. Some telemental health programs, such as I-PCIT, entail remote bug-in-the-ear coaching and thus additionally require Bluetooth earpiece devices. Telemental health treatments that entail naturalistic observations of couples or families who may not always be facing the camera throughout the session require an omnidirectional room microphone to capture the full audio of the room, regardless of client position.Delivery settingsCouple and family telemental health sessions are often grouped into “supervised” and “unsupervised” settings. A supervised setting is one in which clinical staff (albeit not the telemental health provider) is present at the client site. An example of telemental health delivered to a supervised setting is when one is remotely providing mental health care via videoconferencing to a child while that child sits in a pediatrician’s office with a nurse, physician, and/or other health care provider on site. Studies to date of telemental health for children and families delivered to supervised settings have demonstrated strong feasibility, acceptability, efficacy, and client satisfaction (e.g., Myers et al., 2015). Telemental health with certain high-risk client populations may always need to be delivered to a supervised setting. For example, it may be inappropriate to conduct remote sessions with families with maltreatment histories in the absence of a clinical provider at the client site.It is not always feasible to deliver telemental health in supervised settings, and for some forms of couple or family telemental health it may even be preferable to deliver care to an unsupervised natural setting. Indeed, many telemental health interventions are intentionally designed to evaluate couples and families in their own homes rather than in clinic settings (e.g., I-PCIT; Comer et al., 2015; Comer, Furr, Miguel, et al., 2017). Telemental health interventions delivered to unsupervised settings are an increasingly popular telemental health strategy (Luxton, Sirotin, & Mishkind, 2010) and have demonstrated initial feasibility, safety, and efficacy in a growing number of controlled trials (e.g., Comer, Furr, Kerns, et al., 2017; Comer, Furr, Miguel, et al., 2017). However, safety concerns render telemental health treatment in unsupervised settings inappropriate for some clinical populations, a point to which we now turn.Safety planning and crisis managementUsing videoconferencing to provide remote care in unsupervised settings may be inappropriate for certain high-risk client populations (e.g., maltreating families, suicidal clients). However, clinical emergencies occur even after screening out particularly high-risk clients from telemental health practices. Prior to initiating treatment, the telemental health provider and client must develop a detailed risk management plan in the event that a crisis should occur. Telemental health providers should assess potential safety risks in the client site environment (e.g., firearms and/or household hazards). Therapists should also have a secondary way to contact the participant if technology fails in the middle of a session (e.g., a plan that the therapist will call the client’s cell phone). When telemental health is delivered to clinically supervised settings (e.g., local pediatrician’s office, community outpatient clinic, school site), local professionals must be familiar with emergency procedures. Recent telemental health guidelines (American Telemedicine Association, 2017) advise providers to always: (a) identify local emergency resources and phone numbers, (b) familiarize themselves with the location of the nearest emergency resources capable of managing mental health emergencies, and (c) store contact information for clients’ families and designated supports. During the consent process and throughout treatment, clients should be informed and reminded that in the case of an emergency or if they are unable to reach the therapist due to technology failure and require immediate assistance, they should call 911.Technological literacy and comfortTelemental health treatment progress is substantially hindered when participants do not have the knowledge to set up sessions and navigate the features of videoconferencing software. Prior to treatment, it is useful to conduct an informational session over the phone about the technological components of treatment and/or to send clients instructional manuals and troubleshooting resources. Usability is critical for the success of telemental health; interventions that are too complex for clients or for providers will not see widespread adoption and implementation. When resources allow, it is useful to have a dedicated staff member available to provide remote tech support as needed to clients during telemental health sessions. Telemental health providers should also check in frequently with clients to discuss any frustrations with technology and with treatment in general.Therapeutic alliance and engagementClinical trials evaluating couple and family telemental health find high treatment retention, client engagement, client-therapist agreement on therapeutic tasks, client-therapist agreement on therapeutic goals, and client satisfaction, as well as positive affective bonds between clients and therapists (Comer, Furr, Kerns, et al., 2017; Comer, Furr, Miguel, et al., 2017). Indeed, research consistently demonstrates alliance to be comparable across telemental health and office-based treatment modalities (Comer, Furr, Kerns, et al., 2017). These results are promising, but supplementary steps should nonetheless be taken to maintain engagement and the therapeutic alliance in videoconference-based treatment. Real-time screen-sharing activities (and interactive games when children are involved in treatment) can meaningfully increase client engagement during telemental health and enhance client understanding of session content. For example, in a study of videoconferencing-delivered, family-based treatment for early onset obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), Comer, Furr, Kerns, and colleagues (2017) created interactive computer games using Google Drawing and Google Documents that were collaboratively played in session by the child and therapist. One activity included an interactive “build a worry monster” game in which therapists and families selected cartoon monster features from an image bank to build a cartoon “Worry Monster” in order to help children externalize their OCD (Comer, Furr, et al., 2014).ReimbursementTelemental health payment issues vary widely by provider, services offered, population treated, and insurance provider. Medicaid reimbursement covers telemental health in most states (Center for Telehealth and eHealth Law, 2011) and even includes an additional “telehealth originating site facility fee.” States vary, however, as to whether they will reimburse for telemental health outside of delivery to rural or otherwise underserved regions. Unfortunately, many private payers do not currently reimburse for telemental health services; however, trends point to increasing coverage for telemental health by private insurers (Center for Telehealth and eHealth Law, 2011).How Does One Recruit for a Telemental Health Intervention?Many couple and family telemental health providers offer both clinic-based and videoconferencing-based treatment options, and their recruitment for telemental health services does not extend beyond recruitment efforts in place for clinic-based services. Accordingly, clients treated via videoconferencing are often those who initially reach out for services at a provider’s brick-and-mortar office, and then elect to participate in remote treatment options to improve the convenience of care. Broader recruitment efforts for telemental health are needed.Successful recruitment methods for telemental health have included collaboration and engagement with pediatric and primary care practices (e.g., Myers et al., 2015), school settings (Stephan, Lever, Bernstein, Edwards, & Pruitt, 2016), and juvenile justice systems (Batastini, 2016). Outreach to rural and other underserved and remote communities is particularly needed (Nelson & Bui, 2010). Given the increasing role of the Internet as the first point of contact for couples and families seeking health care resources, telemental health providers must maintain a strong web presence.Although telemental health increases opportunities to treat clients near and far, licensure and jurisdiction matters merit comment. At this time, most states require that providers be licensed in the state in which the client is receiving services (regardless of where the therapist is situated at the time of care; see Kramer, Kinn, & Mishkind, 2015 for a review of legal and regulatory issues). Although specific licensure regulations vary across states, for the most part, a telemental health provider can only deliver telemental health services to clients in states in which the provider is licensed; thus, they are important considerations in recruitment.How Does One Test a Telemental Health Intervention?To continue to move the field of couples and family telemental health forward, researchers must systematically rely on research strategies that achieve favorable balances between scientific rigor and clinical relevance.Control conditionsWhen designing a randomized clinical trial to evaluate a telemental health family or couple intervention, the first task is to select an appropriate control condition against which to compare the outcomes of the telemental health intervention. Here, we consider three primary options. First, “no-treatment” and “waitlist” controls assess the overall effect of the intervention but cannot meaningfully isolate the specific effects of the intervention or the effects of delivering the intervention via a videoconferencing portal.A second control condition is one in which participants receive the office-based format of the same treatment. Such a comparison benchmarks outcomes against the same intervention delivered in person, with a common hypothesis being that there will be no difference between the two groups (i.e., a noninferiority trial). In this design, an a priori decision is first made about the minimum difference between the conditions that would be meaningful enough to deem the groups nonequivalent (e.g., a 0.2 SD difference), and then tests are conducted to reject the null hypothesis that the observed difference between the two conditions is less than or equal to the a priori minimum difference deemed meaningful (see Rogers, Howard, & Vessey, 1993). The only component manipulated is the delivery format (Internet vs. face-to-face), as treatment content is held constant, and condition differences can be attributed exclusively to the modality of care. Other trials might hypothesize that the telemental health format will yield a significant improvement over a standard clinic-based format, and indeed some recent trials have found telemental health formats to outperform parallel clinic-based care for family problems (e.g., Comer, Furr, Miguel, et al., 2017).Despite the advantages and rigor inherent in comparing a telemental health intervention with a parallel office-based format of that same intervention, such a comparison requires that participants live close enough to the investigative team so that they can feasibly participate in office-based treatment if that is the condition to which they are assigned. Findings from such a trial may not generalize to the more geographically remote and underserved populations for whom telemental health formats are most needed. As Chou, Bry, and Comer (2017) note, in order to position technology-based treatments for optimal uptake and reach, research needs to examine these treatments in the very populations that they are envisioned to serve.Drawing on a “treatment as usual” (TAU) comparison—in which control participants are provided the standard of care that is routinely given to that population in their own community—increases the portability of a trial and allows the investigator to examine a telemental health couple or family intervention in more remote and underserved populations. Unlike trials comparing telemental health with the same treatment delivered in an office-based format, TAU comparisons do not require that participants live close enough to the investigative team so that they can feasibly participate in either treatment condition. Despite the benefits, however, what exactly constitutes TAU is difficult to operationalize as it varies widely across regions and settings, making it difficult to integrate findings across studies. Further, differences between a telemental health intervention and a TAU condition might be attributed to differences in provider training, quality, or supervision, or to differences in the frequency, duration, or intensity of care, rather than to differences in the treatment delivery format.OutcomesTesting telemental health couple and family interventions requires one to decide what dependent variables to assess and how to assess them. In addition to standard clinical trial outcomes (e.g., symptom responses, diagnostic responses, improvements in functioning and quality of life), investigators of telemental health couple and family interventions are particularly interested in assessing the acceptability and feasibility of the novel intervention format. Matters of treatment satisfaction and therapeutic engagement and alliance are critical. Moreover, investigators of telemental health are wise to assess technological barriers to care, including technology-related disruptions to treatment delivery as well as negative technology-related attitudes and poor technological literacy that can interfere with treatment engagement or moderate treatment responses.Finally, to facilitate subsequent cost-effectiveness analyses, one should record costs and savings associated with treatment delivery. These costs include, but are not limited to, technology to deliver the intervention (both client and therapist expenses), therapist salaries for initial training and ongoing treatment delivery, and supervisor salaries for training and ongoing supervision. Savings that will need to be recorded are beneficial effects of the program (on key outcome variables) as well as savings resulting from reductions in costs typically associated with in-person treatment (e.g., transportation, office space, child care, missed work or school).FundingThe research needed to evaluate the promise and potential of telemental health will be a very costly endeavor. As Chou, Bry, and Comer (2017) note, current federal funding priorities in mental health are focused on an experimental therapeutics agenda—in which conceptual mechanisms underlying intervention effectiveness and neurobiological treatment targets are often prioritized over examinations of treatment outcomes and innovative delivery formats. Researchers working to develop and evaluate telemental health interventions will need to be increasingly creative in order to secure needed funding. Industry partnerships and newer funding sources (e.g., the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute) may be critical for supporting the costly work needed.Telemental Health Interventions or BITs?Telemental health interventions hold great promise to transform the accessibility and scope of real-time mental health care with a provider by overcoming traditional geographic barriers and treating families in their natural settings. However, telemental health interventions for couples and families are not without limitations. Most notably, telemental health does not increase the overall number of individuals, couples, and families who can be treated at a given time. There is an enormous discrepancy between the large numbers in need of care and the relatively small numbers of providers. The discrepancy is so large that Kazdin and Blase (2011) estimated that even doubling the mental health workforce would yield only a minor public health impact. Using synchronous communication technologies to provide real-time services still requires a live provider for every session. As such, BITs that rely largely on self-administration and/or asynchronous communications with providers are better equipped than telemental health interventions to increase the number of individuals, couples, and families that can be treated.BITsAs described earlier, BITs either augment in-person treatment or provide self-help interventions without in-person treatment. Not surprisingly, BITs can take on many forms (Muñoz, 2017). Deciding which type of BIT suits a particular target population and intervention goals requires an understanding of the different practices.Automated BITsAutomated couple and family BITs omit therapist, coach, or staff support and rely solely on technology to provide the intervention to consumers. This category of automated BITs includes apps, websites, and/or phone lines that use voice or text recognition software to respond to client needs. Without the need for human support, automated BITs have the potential to reach limitless number of clients continuously as there is no need to coordinate schedules or limitation of staff hours. Additionally, the potential for translation of these programs into different languages can further increase their reach. The quality of the automated BIT can range from standardized information, such as learning about a particular disorder, to personalized prompts and feedback based on an array of previously entered or acquired data.Guided BITsIn guided BITs, like automated BITs, technology provides the majority of the couple and family intervention. However, guided BITs also include personal support in the form of a therapist or coach. There is great variety within guided BITs as to the quantity and intensity of human support provided, ranging from the high end of using therapists throughout the intervention to the low end of using trained staff to aid in technological issues on an as-needed basis. Compared with in-person delivery of services and telemental health, guided BITs have the potential to significantly decrease delivery costs, improve the reach of interventions across geographic boundaries, and increase the flexibility of services (e.g., online activities can be completed on the user’s schedule, not on the provider’s schedule). However, guided BITs still involve some staff contact and associated salary and training costs.Compared with automated BITs, guided BITs provide users with a greater sense of accountability, encouragement, and motivation to both complete and engage in program content. Users in guided BITs, compared with automated BITs, tend to report higher levels of satisfaction with the intervention (Aardoom et al., 2016). Additionally, within couple and family interventions, guided BITs show superior completion rates and clinical outcomes compared with automated BITs (Roddy, Nowlan, & Doss, 2016). However, with advancements in automated feedback (e.g., including, and tailored to, participants’ responses in the program), there is some emerging evidence that automated BITs are getting closer to guided BITs in their completion rates and clinical outcomes (e.g., Dear et al., 2015; Kelders Bohlmeijer, Pots, & van Gemert-Pijnen, 2015; Titov et al., 2015). Our sense is that, with improvements in technology, automated BITs may soon be able to provide contingent and personalized feedback rivaling that found in Guided BITs. What remains to be seen is how important the personal connection with a coach, absent in even the best automated BITs, is in encouraging program completion.Blended BITsBlended BITs can also be used to augment traditional in-person couple and family services rather than substitute for them. Many therapists are already utilizing BITs in this manner (often without labeling it as such) by encouraging clients to use cell phone apps to track behaviors, moods, or automatic thoughts between in-person sessions or to monitor sleep and activity with wearable technology (Muñoz, 2017). Augmented BITs are easy to incorporate into clinicians’ current practice and, for clients who are accustomed to using their phones or computers daily, may be more attractive than diaries or worksheets for completing homework assignments. Additionally, the supplemental reminders and practice have been shown to improve treatment outcomes (e.g., Jones et al., 2014). However, augmented BITs do little to increase the reach of interventions. Because clinicians incorporating blended BITs provide the majority of clinical work in face-to-face sessions, the level of training to provide quality intervention is equally as high as training an in-person provider who does not use BITs. Furthermore, the provider’s ability to interact with the client via BITs is limited by the provider’s availability, therapy training, and knowledge of the technology.How Does One Design and Implement a BIT?After deciding to build a couple or family BIT, there are multiple decision points in the design process. Below, we include several considerations and their implications for BIT design.Will the BIT Meet the Intended Need?To ensure that one’s vision is aligned with couples’ or families’ perceived needs, conducting a series of interviews is essential. The first two sets of interviews should consist of the target audience, with two sets being helpful to ensure that ideas converge across the two sets. In these interviews, open-ended questions should dominate: Do they see a need? If so, what? What would they want to address that need? What would they be willing (and not willing) to do to address that need? Toward the end of the interview, turning to more specific ideas for BIT content can be helpful. If one is contemplating building an augmented BIT, utilizing additional interviews with providers that will be assigning and utilizing the BIT is important.Who Will Be Using the BIT?With more than one user (e.g., both partners of a couple or coparenting team; a parent and child), one must consider which activities they will be doing together and which they will doing separately. Completing activities jointly allows for opportunities to discuss the material in the moment. However, joint completion also has its disadvantages. It may be more difficult for more than one person to view the content (if completed on a smartphone) and different reading speeds may create frustration. Working together may also limit each individual’s ability to reflect on their own internal experience, especially if users are asked to write in their responses. Completing the BIT together also requires both partners to be available and in the same place; in contrast, individual activities can be completed on the bus/train home from work or when parents work different schedules. Finally, if the dyad or family is experiencing conflict, joint completion of activities may increase the risk that the BIT would start an argument.In the BITs we have developed, we have found a mixture of individual and joint activities to be the most useful when more than one user is involved (Doss, Benson, Georgia, & Christensen, 2013). For example, in the OurRelationship BIT (Doss et al., 2016), both members of a distressed couple work together to select, understand, and then solve a relationship problem. The majority of each phase—where users view tailored feedback about their relationship and write about how the ideas apply to their own relationship—is completed individually. At the end of each phase, couples are brought together in a joint activity to have a structured conversation where the program displays portions of what users wrote during the individual activities and the couple is encouraged to discuss them. However, other online BITs for relationships encourage couples to complete all activities together to maximize opportunities for discussion (e.g., Braithwaite & Fincham, 2014). Therefore, the best balance of joint and individual activities will depend on the BIT’s content, purpose, and audience.Native Apps Versus Web-Based ProgramsNative apps, which are programs built for a particular device (usually a smartphone or tablet), have important advantages. They can be downloaded onto the device and subsequently used without an Internet connection. Native apps also tend to interact more seamlessly with a device’s other functionality, which can be important if GPS data, motion sensors, or related functionality is a central part of the BIT. However, native apps also have their disadvantages. At a minimum, two versions need to be built—one for the Apple operating systems (iPhone, iPad) and one for Android systems (Android smartphones such as Samsung); additionally, depending on the functionality the app needs to harness, it may be necessary to have different versions for smartphones and tablets even within the same operating system. Those multiple builds increase costs for initial build and maintenance and additional complexity in managing the resulting data.Web-based applications, in contrast, require an Internet connection (via a computer or smartphone) and cannot take as much advantage of the device’s functionality. However, using a device’s Internet browser, only a single version needs to be built (often at a lower cost than a single version of a native app), reducing both costs and complexity of a web-based BIT. In the rest of this article, we are going to focus on describing web-based guided BITs for two reasons: (a) currently, they are more cost effective for investigators seeking to develop their first BIT, and (b) we expect any information we would provide on native apps would become quickly outdated; in contrast, the recent rise of HTML5 as the dominant web language across devices and operating systems forecasts a relative stability of functionality required for web-based BITs.Necessary Components of a Web-Based BITIf a web-based BIT (instead of a native app) is the best fit, one must consider the requirements of the intervention content itself as well as the requirements of the platform in which the activities are housed.If one’s goal is to deliver an intervention with text, audio, video, and some interactivity (e.g., clicking, drag-and-drop interactions), there are several excellent and relatively inexpensive options available; at this time, we recommend Articulate (www.articulate.com), Adobe Captivate, and Lectora. With a larger initial budget, the Adapt open-source functionality (www.AdaptLearning.org) is a good option. Content in Adapt is “responsive” (displays different content or using different layouts based on the size of the device’s screen). Additionally, Adapt has more options to interact with an online database, facilitating saving and recalling complex variables (e.g., calculated formulas) across the user’s sessions in the BIT.In addition to the content of the BIT, one may also need to consider housing that content in a learner management system (LMS), such as Blackboard, Moodle, or Totara. An LMS allows one to require users to register for the intervention (restricting who has access to the content—critical for a randomized trial), make content availability contingent on completion of previous content, and tract usage of the content. An LMS will also be necessary if the online content needs to interface with a database—essential to save users’ responses in the program, to make content available across different sessions/devices, or to pull information from different accounts (e.g., allowing the wife to see a subset of the husband’s responses).The Role of Coaches in a Guided BITCoaches in a guided BIT tend to help users apply program content, reinforce fundamental skills, brainstorm solutions to any issues that may arise, and ensure that users are not misinterpreting content (Schueller, Tomasino, & Mohr, 2016). Coaches also provide a direct contact for technical assistance and problems with program functionality.The professional training level of coaches does not seem to impact clinical outcomes. For example, Titov et al. (2010) found no significant differences between technician-based and clinician-based support in a BIT for depression, with both significantly improving symptom outcomes more than a waitlist control group. This pattern suggests that professional support may not be necessary for BITs to function successfully (Titov et al., 2010), especially since many guided BITs are tightly scripted. As such, the use of paraprofessionals or graduate level trainees as coaches is both cost efficient and effective.Furthermore, less may actually be more when it comes to the frequency of coach support. Indeed, BITs with about 90 total minutes of coach contact throughout the course of the intervention have been shown to outperform BITs that used therapist support as primary delivery of program content, suggesting that more frequent contact might negatively impact consumer volition (Schueller et al., 2016). Therefore, Schueller and colleagues (2016) recommend that BITs include few and regularly spaced opportunities for coach support. For example, users in the OurRelationship BIT are able to complete online content at their own pace until they reach three program milestones, at which points they are asked to meet with their coach before continuing. This model helps to ensure that program content is well understood before it is applied and expanded upon in later modules, while at the same time allowing users considerable flexibility to complete activities on their own schedules during the interim.Contact modality, such as email, synchronous messaging, phone calls, and video conferencing, plays an important role in BIT adherence. Asynchronous emails have been found to help increase overall program use (Mohr et al., 2013); moreover, texts may be a more efficient medium than email (Schueller et al., 2016).How Does One Recruit for a BIT?For blended BITs, targeting the providers who will use the BIT will likely be the most efficient recruitment strategy; this type of recruitment approach is described in the Telemental Health Interventions section. For automated or guided BITs, effective recruitment strategies will likely include a combination of agreements with existing organizations and online recruitment targeting couples/families directly. If problem recognition and/or education about BITs is the advertising goal, then reaching out to the target audience—in person or online—is warranted. For example, on Facebook and using Google display ads, one can target potential participants based on their geographic location, race, ethnicity, education, income, and other interests/websites visited. In contrast, if one hopes to recruit samples who are already seeking help (but may or may not have decided to seek a BIT), then advertising where the population is likely to seek that help can be effective. For example, on online search engines such as Google and Bing, one can target advertisements to individuals’ searches related to presenting problems or interventions. If the BIT is an app, then advertising on the App Store and/or Google Play are natural ways to target individuals searching for apps related to your BIT.How Does One Test a BIT?There are four broad considerations in conducting an online randomized controlled trial (RCT) of a BIT—assessment, random assignment, study duration, and selection of appropriate control groups.AssessmentCurrently, the most popular online assessment programs are Qualtrics and SurveyMonkey; we suspect that most universities in the United States have an institutional subscription to one or the other. Both programs provide numerous question types and complex logic functionality. Alternatively, if a BIT is paired with an LMS, many eLearning software programs such as Articulate and Adapt include integrated assessment functionally (enhancing user experience); however, the functionality tends to be more limited than dedicated assessment functionality such as Qualtrics. Additionally, given the relatively high rate of attrition in BITs, it is important to conduct assessments early in the intervention to obtain estimates of change for all participants. These early data points can be used to reduce bias in subsequent data analyses.OutcomesAs described in detail in the Telemental Health Interventions section, measures of satisfaction and engagement are important for couple and family BITs as well. To construct cost-effectiveness estimates, in addition to the training and delivery costs detailed in the Telemental Health Interventions section, it is important to maintain accurate estimates of costs associated with initial development (and any subsequent refinement) of the BIT. Initial development costs for BITs are often significantly higher than ongoing costs to deliver the treatment and thus weigh heavily on cost estimates. In particular, costs associated with construction of the app/online content, LMS (if relevant), and online advertising should be recorded.DurationGiven the rapidly changing pace of technology, some authors have argued that it is inappropriate to restrict changes to an intervention during evaluation because, by the time the RCT is complete, the tested intervention is outdated (e.g., Mohr et al., 2015). If rapid recruitment is not possible, then authors have recommended conducting “trials of intervention principles” (Mohr et al., 2015) or sequential, multiple assignment, randomized trials (SMART designs; Collins, Nahum-Shani, & Almirall, 2014) that permit inclusion of alternative or updated versions of an intervention.Control ConditionsWhen selecting a control group for a BIT RCT, many of the same considerations apply as for in-person studies. However, when recruiting participants online, it is especially important to consider that any participants assigned to a control group will likely have other options (outside of the study) at their fingertips. To reduce the number of control couples or families who seek services elsewhere, it may be beneficial to make the control group a wait-list control group (if the waiting period is not too long) or a viable alternative treatment (either another active intervention or a placebo-control intervention).What Are Important Ethical/Legal Considerations in Delivering and Testing a BIT?Testing and delivering couple and family BITs adds several important ethical and legal considerations to those typically involved in face-to-face interventions.License JurisdictionIn many cases, a BIT can be considered a self-help intervention (with or without “coach,” not “therapist,” support) and thus does not require a license to deliver. However, if the BIT provides services that can be understood to represent the practice of psychology that would otherwise require a license to provide, then one must be careful that the therapist is licensed in the state or jurisdiction where participants reside. Issues of license jurisdiction are described in more detail in the Telemental Health Interventions section above.Online AssessmentIn conducting online assessments, one important consideration is whether your data will need to be Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) compliant (including the HITECH Act— “Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health” —and/or related Department of Health and Human Services rules). At the time of writing, both Qualtrics and SurveyMonkey require a premium level of services and a special contract that designates them as a Business Associate to be HIPAA compliant.VideoIf the couple or family intervention is subject to HIPAA regulations, then HIPAA-compliant video services need to be used. Although several are available, VSee is a provider that specializes in HIPAA-compliant videoconferencing at affordable rates. If an intervention is not subject to HIPAA, investigators should consider whether using a videoconferencing software that will be more familiar to users might be a better fit (especially for participants who are not technologically savvy). For example, FaceTime offers “end-to-end” encryption, meaning that Apple can not access the content of the calls. Conversations over Skype and Google Hangouts are encrypted; however, this encryption is not currently “end-to-end.”EmergenciesWhen concerning levels of domestic violence or suicidality are reported, we suggest participants should be immediately provided with both the website and phone number for the relevant hotline—either the National Domestic Violence Hotline or the National Suicide Prevention lifeline. Most assessment functionality allows for this contact information to be provided in real time in a conditional manner based on a user’s response to a previous item.Mandatory ReportingFinally, if implementing a couple or family BIT across state lines (or internationally), investigators must consider that mandatory reporting guidelines for child and elder abuse vary by state. There are several helpful compilations of state laws regarding child abuse (https://www.childwelfare.gov/topics/systemwide/laws-policies/state/) and elder abuse (https://ncea.acl.gov/whatwedo/policy/state.html).Technology’s Impact on the Conceptual Framework for Couple and Family InterventionsTo this point, we have focused on the impact that technology can have in improving the efficacy or reach of interventions for couples and families. However, it is also important to consider how technology can affect the field’s conceptual framework. First, the increased reach of technology-enhanced interventions allows for more diverse and larger samples of couples and families, which, in turn, permits testing treatment moderators such as race, ethnicity, acculturation, income, education, or type of relationship problems. For instance, despite guidance on how to tailor interventions for African American couples (e.g., Boyd-Franklin, Kelly, & Durham, 2008), there have been only a handful of studies that have examined differential outcomes by race or ethnicity (e.g., Doss et al., 2012; Rhoades, 2015).Second, technology allows us to collect new measures with increasing sophistication and specificity, improving our ability to identify and test mechanisms of our treatments. One of the central challenges of assessing mechanisms is that, to permit the strongest evidence of their role, mechanisms should be measured after they have been affected by the intervention but before they have a chance to change the ultimate outcome variable. Technology, with its ability to integrate more frequent measures of putative mechanisms, allows the opportunity to assess mechanisms without making a priori assumptions about the exact timeframe. More frequent assessments also increase the chance of detecting change in an individual before it affects the broader couple or family system. Additionally, technology increases the opportunities to collect implicit or behavioral measures (e.g., automated calculation of vocal stress during real-world conversations), increasing the chances that change in the mechanism can be captured before a participant can self-report on that change (and thus before it has the opportunity to affect the participant’s global evaluations).Third, the availability of technology-enhanced interventions may inform repackaging of our treatments. For example, in the individual adult literatures, transdiagnostic interventions have gained significant momentum (e.g., Sauer-Zavala et al., 2017); recent studies have further demonstrated that web-based transdiagnostic interventions seem to have similar effects across anxiety and depressive disorders (e.g., Dear et al., 2015; Titov et al., 2015). Although there have been recent calls to combine couple- and child-focused interventions, studies to date have utilized relatively small samples (e.g., Zemp, Milek, Cummings, Cina, & Bodenmann, 2016) which may have missed small- and medium-sized benefits of this combination. Furthermore, efforts to develop and test transdiagnostic interventions for youth (Queen, Barlow, & Ehrenreich-May, 2014) have been initiated but large-sample web-based studies would allow more detailed examination of these possibilities.ConclusionWe believe the role of technology in couple and family interventions is expanding rapidly; the question is no longer if technology integration can be helpful but how and when it can be helpful. Indeed, technology has enormous potential to improve the efficacy of our face-to-face interventions, facilitate skill acquisition and application to real-world settings, decrease provider burden, and expand the reach of our interventions to couples and families who would otherwise not receive services. However, technology is not a panacea; if utilized incorrectly or inappropriately, it could decrease the efficacy of our treatments and increase risks for our clients. In this article, we have identified key considerations and provided conceptual and methodological guidance for investigators in the successful development, refinement, and evaluation of their couple and family telemental health interventions or BITs. Although the relatively young field of technology-based and technology-facilitated treatments has already amassed an impressive initial base of knowledge, many of the most important answers are still ahead of us. As in any new area of study, advances have emerged quickly, and we are just now starting to see consistency in terminology and consensus in methodology. Research and development efforts need to stay agile in order to keep pace with the rapidly evolving possibilities of modern technology. The conceptual frameworks and perspectives on technology-based interventions outlined throughout this paper can serve to guide the next wave of needed innovation and research in a manner that maximizes both scientific rigor and clinical utility. Disruptive behavior disorders (DBDs) are among the most common disorders affecting young children (e.g., Egger & Angold, 2006), and when left untreated, are associated with complex and intractable trajectories over time (e.g., Lavigne et al., 2001). Guidelines suggest that psychosocial interventions, when available, should constitute first-line treatment (Comer et al., 2013; Eyberg et al., 2008). Behavioral parent training, in particular, has shown the strongest support (Comer et al., 2013; Eyberg et al., 2008; Kaminski et al., 2008). parent–child interaction therapy (PCIT; Eyberg & Funderburg, 2011) is one such supported parent-training program. Throughout treatment, parents practice positive attending and effective discipline while the therapist monitors family interactions from behind a one-way mirror and provides live coaching via a parent-worn bug-in-the-ear device.Despite treatment advances, barriers interfere with proper service access. Regional professional workforce shortages in mental health care impinge on the availability of services (Comer & Barlow, 2014). Transportation barriers and stigma-related concerns about going to a mental health facility (Owens et al., 2002) further limit the accessibility and acceptability of clinic-based services. Remote technologies are increasingly being leveraged to expand the reach and scope of children’s mental health care, given their potential to overcome traditional barriers to services and promote skill generalization by extending skill engagement beyond brick-and-mortar sessions (Comer & Barlow, 2014; Jones et al., 2013; Kazdin & Blase, 2011). However, applications to early child DBDs have been limited. To date, controlled evaluations in this area have only involved hybrid models that conduct most parent training in person, despite other treatment components being conducted remotely (Jones et al., 2014; Myers et al., 2015). Such programs are not fully liberated from the geographical obstacles that hinder service accessibility for many.Comer and colleagues (2015) have suggested that PCIT may be particularly amenable to a videoteleconferencing (VTC) format, given that, by design, the PCIT therapist is not in the same room as the family for most of the treatment, but rather is remotely monitoring from another room and providing real-time feedback to parent(s) via a parent-worn bug-in-the-ear device. With VTC, therapists can remotely provide in-the-moment feedback during parent–child interactions in the home, regardless of a family’s geographic proximity to a mental health clinic. Such Internet-delivered PCIT (I-PCIT) can afford a comparable quantity of therapist contact relative to standard, clinic-based PCIT. Moreover, treating families in homes may enhance the ecological validity of treatment by providing parent coaching in the very settings in which child behaviors are most problematic. VTC platforms are being increasingly used to remotely provide full courses of real-time treatment in the home for a number of clinical populations (e.g., Comer et al., 2017), although applications to early DBDs are limited.This is the first randomized trial evaluating VTC to offer fully remote behavioral parent training with a live therapist. Three–five-year olds with DBDs were randomly assigned to receive either I-PCIT or standard clinic-based PCIT. We hypothesized that I-PCIT would: (a) be associated with productive engagement and high treatment satisfaction; and (b) yield significant improvements maintained across a 6-month follow-up period. We further predicted that I-PCIT and standard clinic-based PCIT would yield similar outcome trajectories and response rates across time.MethodParticipantsRacially/ethnically diverse participants were 40 children ages 3–5 with a DBD defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed.; DSM–IV; APA, 1994) and their caregiver(s).

Table 2TABLES AND FIGUREStable/figure thumbnailTable 2. Overview of Included MeasuresView larger image > in this page > in new window> Download slidepresents a summary and description of measures included.TreatmentsPCIT (Eyberg & Funderburg, 2011) is a well-established, clinic-based, behavioral parent-training program for young children that places central emphasis on improving parent–child interaction patterns and the quality of parent–child relationships. PCIT draws on attachment and social learning theories to emphasize positive attention, consistency, problem-solving, and communication. Parents first learn to build a positive and rewarding parent–child relationship via positive attending skills and differential reinforcement, and then learn effective discipline strategies and time-out procedures. The precise length of PCIT for a given family is titrated to the quickness with which the family achieves mastery criteria. A distinguishing feature of PCIT is the use of in-session parent coaching. The therapist monitors the family from behind a one-way mirror and provides live and individualized coaching through a parent-worn bug-in-the-ear device.I-PCIT (Comer et al., 2015) follows traditional clinic-based PCIT, but uses a VTC platform to enable therapists to remotely deliver treatment to families in their homes. Instead of interacting in front of a one-way mirror at a clinic, families use a webcam to broadcast home-based interactions to their therapists, who remotely provide live coaching through a parent-worn Bluetooth earpiece. Technological, administrative, security, and hardware considerations for telemental health care are considered elsewhere (Chou et al., 2016; Comer et al., 2015).Procedure and Data AnalysisProcedures were approved by the Florida International University and Boston University institutional review boards and informed consent was obtained for all families. Participants were recruited from the flow of families seeking treatment for child-behavior problems at one of two university-affiliated clinics in [Miami, FL and Boston, MA]. Independent evaluators (IEs) masked to treatment condition conducted Kiddie-Disruptive Behavior Disorder Schedule (K-DBDS; Keenan, Wakschlag, & Danis, 2001) diagnostic interviews, and generated Clinical Global Impressions (CGI; Guy & Bonato, 1970) and Children’s Global Assessment Scale (CGAS; Shaffer et al., 1983) scores, at baseline, posttreatment, and 6-month follow-up. Diagnostic interviews were conducted in the clinic, regardless of treatment condition, to maintain the masked study design. Caregivers also completed parent-report forms at baseline, midtreatment, posttreatment, and 6-month follow-up online through a secure and encrypted Web-survey application. Families received $40 for each evaluation. Services were provided at no cost. To standardize care across I-PCIT participants, I-PCIT families were provided with a temporary equipment kit for the duration of their participation (∼$150; see Comer et al., 2015). Therapists (n = 9; seven women, two men; 22.2% ethnic/racial minority status) were clinical psychology trainees who completed yearly intensive didactic training with a PCIT master trainer, followed by cotreatment roles on two cases. Therapists self-completed session-integrity checklists, and session recordings were reviewed during weekly supervision with a clinical psychologist. The same therapists delivered treatment across conditions, and supervision groups simultaneously provided supervision for Internet and clinic-based cases. The lead supervisor also selected 36 random sessions (5% of the total 719 sessions conducted across the study) and completed independent treatment-integrity checks; treatment integrity was high (88%). IEs met internal certification and reliability procedures, developed with the K-DBDS lead author. IEs presented interview results to supervision and diagnoses and CGI/CGAS scores were collaboratively generated.Analyses were conducted on the intent-to-treat sample (N = 40). Baseline differences between groups were evaluated using t and χ2 tests, and linear regressions controlling for site and therapist-evaluated differences in treatment satisfaction and treatment barriers across groups. Hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) was conducted to model the nonindependence of data due to nesting of repeated observations (Level 1) within children (Level 2), using maximum-likelihood estimation of parameters to account for missing data (0% of data were missing at baseline; 12.5% at posttreatment; 32.5% at follow-up). HLM mixed-effects models accounted for missing data and used the data from the full intent-to-treat sample. For each HLM, treatment group, study site, therapist, the natural log (ln) of time (weeks since baseline), and the Group × ln(Time) interaction were fixed-effect predictors, and the intercept (scaled to the baseline assessment; i.e., time = 0) was the single random effect (allowing individuals to vary in their mean-outcome values). The MIXED procedure in SPSS 21 was used for mixed model analyses. Fitted models were used to calculate estimated mean scores at each time point. Clinical significance was evaluated with between- and within-subjects effect sizes (d), as well as by examining rates of posttreatment and follow-up treatment response (CGI-Improvement = 1 or 2), excellent response (CGI-Improvement = 1), diagnostic response to baseline principal diagnosis, and diagnostic response to all DBDs. Intent-to-treat analyses on responder rates were based on an assumption that cases of posttreatment or follow-up missing data were not responders. For each responder type, binomial logistic regressions (controlling for site and therapist) examined whether condition predicted response rate.ResultsFigure 1TABLES AND FIGUREStable/figure thumbnailFigure 1.

Treatment retention was high, with 70% of families in each condition completing their full treatment course. Among families completing treatment, the mean number of sessions until achieving PCIT mastery criteria was 21.2 (SD = 7.4); number of sessions did not differ across conditions (MInternet = 21.7 vs. MClinic = 20.8), t(26) = 0.35, p = .73. Treatment satisfaction was high across both conditions, as rated on the Client Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ-8; Larsen et al., 1979; MInternet = 30.1 vs. MClinic = 28.5; highest possible score = 32) and the Therapy Attitude Inventory (TAI; Brestan et al., 1999; MInternet = 45.9 vs. MClinic = 45.1; highest possible score = 50). Treatment condition did not predict posttreatment, CSQ-8 F(3, 29) = .71, p = .50; βCondition = −1.63, p = .25, or TAI scores F(3, 29) = 1.57, p = .23; βCondition = −1.23, p = .48. I-PCIT was associated with fewer barriers to treatment participation than clinic-based PCIT, F(3, 29) = 7.62, p < .001; βCondition = 8.40, p = .01, MInternet = 50.1 versus MClinic = 58.5.Treatment Outcomes Across TimeTable 3TABLES AND FIGUREStable/figure thumbnailTable 3.

For child-behavior problems and burden to caregivers, there was a significant effect of time (see Table 4). Specifically, across conditions, Eyberg Child Behavior Inventory (ECBI; Eyberg & Pincus, 1999) Intensity, Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL; Achenbach & Rescorla, 2000) Externalizing, and ECBI Problem scores significantly improved across time. Change leveled off somewhat between posttreatment and follow-up. Figure 2TABLES AND FIGUREStable/figure thumbnailFigure 2.

Across these three outcomes, there were no significant interaction effects of Time×Condition.

Clinical Significance of Child Outcomes at Posttreatment and at 6-Month Follow-UpView larger image > in this page > in new window> Download slide(top) presents within-subjects effect sizes (d) across outcomes, by treatment condition. Effects for child-behavior problems and burden to caregivers from pre-to-post and from pre-to-follow-up were all “large” to “very large” (Cohen, 1988; Sawilowsky, 2009) for I-PCIT and “medium” to “very large” for clinic-based PCIT. Nonsignificant between-groups effects were relatively negligible in magnitude (see Table 5, middle). Among children who completed a full course of treatment (n = 28), 85.7% of I-PCIT children and 78.6% of clinic-based PCIT children were treatment responders (i.e., CGI-Improvement = 1 or 2) at posttreatment; 83.3% of I-PCIT treatment completers and 72.7% of clinic-based PCIT treatment completers were treatment responders at follow-up. Moreover, among children who completed a full course of treatment, 50% of I-PCIT children and 17.6% of clinic-based PCIT children were “excellent responders” (i.e., CGI-Improvement = 1) at posttreatment; 33.3% of I-PCIT treatment completers and 25.0% of clinic-based PCIT treatment completers were “excellent responders” at follow-up. Responder rates for intent-to-treat analyses found strong treatment response rates at posttreatment across conditions and somewhat lower response rates at follow-up (see Table 5, bottom). Diagnostic response rates are also presented in Table 5 (bottom). The rate of posttreatment excellent response (CGI-Improvement = 1) was significantly higher in I-PCIT than in clinic-based PCIT (see Table 5, bottom). Other response rates were equivalent across conditions.DiscussionThe present study provides the first evidence from a controlled trial supporting the use of real-time VTC to remotely deliver behavioral parent training to the home setting. After treatment, intent-to-treat analyses found that 70% of children treated with I-PCIT showed treatment response, and at 6-month follow-up, 55% continued to show treatment response. Further, roughly half of the children treated with I-PCIT no longer met criteria for a DBD at posttreatment or at 6-month follow-up. The effects of I-PCIT on children’s symptoms and burden to parents were large-to-very-large in magnitude, and important to note, these outcomes and symptom trajectories were comparable to those observed in children randomized to standard clinic-based PCIT. Of note, the rate of excellent response at posttreatment was significantly higher in youth treated with I-PCIT relative to those treated with clinic-based PCIT, and parents treated with I-PCIT perceived fewer barriers to their treatment participation than parents treated with clinic-based PCIT. These findings build on the small but growing literature supporting the promising role of remote technologies for expanding the delivery of behavioral parent training (Jones et al., 2014; Kirkman et al., 2016; Myers et al., 2015), and add to broader efforts leveraging new technologies to expand the reach and scope of indicated mental health care (Comer & Barlow, 2014; Kazdin & Blase, 2011).Relative to other evaluated technology-based programs that incorporate real-time behavioral parent training, I-PCIT is novel in its use of VTC to remotely deliver all parent training components. Indeed, I-PCIT is fully liberated from the geographical constraints that limit the accessibility of hybrid models forming the basis of much of the behavioral parent training in the clinic. Important to note, in addition to positive child outcomes, we found I-PCIT to be associated with high engagement and treatment satisfaction, and reduced perceived barriers to participation relative to clinic-based PCIT. With continued support in geographically diverse populations, I-PCIT may play an important role in overcoming geographic barriers to care for those living in rural, remote, or otherwise underserved regions characterized by limited local treatment options. For those in regions with access to quality care, research is needed to examine the relative merits of emerging technology-based treatment options to identify for whom technology-enhanced treatments might best be suited (i.e., technology could be used to extend in-session content beyond the treatment hour (as Jones et al., 2014 suggested) versus telemental health formats like I-PCIT in which all of the treatment is conducted remotely in real time. Moreover, the present findings that, (a) the rate of posttreatment excellent response was significantly higher among youth treated with I-PCIT than clinic-based PCIT, and (b) I-PCIT was associated with fewer parent-perceived barriers to participation than clinic-based PCIT, underscore the important role I-PCIT can play, even in regions with access to quality clinic-based parent training.Of note, although I-PCIT may address geographic disparities, the reliance on live sessions with a provider means that I-PCIT alone cannot solve broader mental health-care workforce-power problems (Kazdin & Blase, 2011). Even after addressing geographic workforce disparities, there is still an enormous discrepancy between the large numbers of individuals in need of care and the relatively small numbers of providers delivering care. Lower intensity, technology-based treatment options are needed to buttress real-time technology-based treatments. Self-administered e-health programs that have parents watch recorded parent-training modules have shown initial promise in open trials (Kirkman et al., 2016), sometimes with additional telephone-based support (Sourander et al., 2016). Such approaches will likely play an important role in stepped-care models that reserve higher intensity treatments requiring extensive provider time for more severe cases.Study limitations merit comment. First, the sample size in this initial trial of VTC methods for remotely delivering parent training to the home may have been underpowered to detect between-groups differences, although within-subjects analyses did yield significant and sizable results and significant differences were found in rates of excellent response and barriers to treatment. Continued studies with larger samples incorporating noninferiority designs are needed to examine issues of comparability between treatments. Second, the comparison to standard clinic-based PCIT offered a conservative I-PCIT evaluation, benchmarking it against the same treatment delivered in person, but this comparison also required participants to live close enough to one of the two recruitment sites so they could feasibly participate in either of the treatment conditions as assigned. Accordingly, although I-PCIT itself was an entirely remote format, the present findings may not generalize to the more geographically remote and underserved populations for whom VTC formats may be particularly necessary (see Chou, Bry, & Comer, 2017). Research comparing I-PCIT to usual care in rural populations is needed, given that technology access may differ across regions. Third, we provided equipment kits to I-PCIT families so differences in treatment response could not be attributed to differences in household technology. Although many families already own sufficient equipment for I-PCIT, some participants who benefited from I-PCIT may not have independently owned proper equipment to participate in I-PCIT outside of this study. Fourth, we presently focused on the main outcomes of I-PCIT; examination of other outcomes and mediators, such as parent stress, parent–child interactions, and parenting practices, was beyond the scope of this analysis. Fifth, inclusion criteria focused on parent reports and IE assessments, and did not directly incorporate teacher/daycare-provider reports. Although the K-DBDS (Keenan et al., 2001) assesses symptoms across multiple settings, incorporating direct teacher/daycare-provider assessments might have yielded a more representative sample of DBD youth. Finally, families lacking Internet accessibility will not be able to benefit from I-PCIT. Almost half of participating families reported annual incomes over $100,000. Encouragingly, the overwhelming majority of U.S. families now have Internet access, and digital divides based on income, race, and age are steadily disappearing (Pew Research Center, 2015).Despite limitations, this study offers the first controlled evaluation of VTC to offer fully remote behavioral parent training to the home setting with a live therapist, and provides support for the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of I-PCIT. Although behavioral parent-training programs are well-supported and recommended as first-line treatment for early onset DBDs, problems remain in the accessibility of quality care. Against a concerning backdrop of reduced availability of and reliance on psychosocial treatments in preschool-aged youth and increased pharmacological intervention for DBDs in the absence of relevant controlled evaluations (Comer et al., 2010; Olfson et al., 2010), the present findings underscore the urgency to overcome reimbursement challenges to telemental health and improve dissemination of technology-based care that can transform the reach of indicated care. \""

              "\"Veterans face a variety of stressors related to their military service (Institute of Medicine, 2014; Tanielian et al., 2008). Most veterans who return from military conflict do not have a mental health condition, but all veterans “experience a period of readjustment as they reintegrate into life with family, friends, and community” (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration [SAMHSA], 2012, p. 1; Tanielian et al., 2008). Those individuals must juggle a variety of sometimes conflicting family and military-related responsibilities, learn to readjust to environments where behaviors associated with a constant state of readiness are no longer needed, and process combat-related exposure that may collectively contribute to problems for both veterans and their families (Institute of Medicine, 2014; SAMHSA, 2012).Veterans who are exposed to combat are more likely to report normal reactions to stress including depression, hopelessness, insomnia, nightmares, feelings of rejection, aggressive behavior, and substance misuse (SAMHSA, 2012). They also report higher levels of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), major depression, generalized anxiety, intermittent explosive disorder, and substance misuse after returning from conflict (Lazar, 2014; SAMHSA, 2012; Tanielian et al., 2008). Veterans with PTSD and major depression are also frequently diagnosed with other comorbid mental health-related diagnoses, experience elevated death rates from suicide and homicide, report more work-related problems such as unemployment, and are more likely to be homeless than the average person (Lazar, 2014).Many veterans are not receiving adequate mental health treatment for these conditions (Lazar, 2014; Tanielian et al., 2008). Lazar (2014) surveyed veterans who returned from conflict in Iraq and Afghanistan and found that only 23%–40% with a diagnosable mental health condition reported receiving help from a provider in the previous year. Although the percentages of those who meet criteria for a diagnosis and subsequently seek treatment vary (23%–40% in the Lazar study vs. 53% in the Tanielian study), it is clear that many veterans who are returning from conflict are not receiving adequate treatment for their mental health-related problems. Collectively, the Lazar (2014) and the Tanielian et al. (2008) studies suggest that the problem is potentially related to veterans either not choosing to seek services or a shortage of providers located near the veteran.A number of barriers that prevent veterans who are in distress from seeking mental health services have been presented in the literature (United States Government Accountability Office [USGAO], 2011; Tanielian et al., 2008). Those barriers include the following: (a) lack of access to mental health services (e.g., lack of transportation to a provider, the distance that veterans must travel to obtain services is too far, etc.), (b) negative stigma associated with utilizing mental health services (e.g., concerns about how other individuals will view them if they found out about the veteran seeking treatment), (c) lack of awareness of mental health conditions or treatments such as whether their symptoms rise to the level of a diagnosis or believe that no treatments are available to address their symptoms, and (d) concerns about whether the veteran would qualify for services through the Veterans Health Administration ([VHA]; Tanielian et al., 2008; USGAO, 2011). Given the consequences of these barriers (e.g., they serve to prevent veterans from seeking or obtaining treatment), more work needs to be done to reduce their impact on veterans.Telepsychology, or the use of technology to provide mental health services (American Psychological Association, 2013), broadly encompasses a variety of direct formats including videoconferencing, phone, and instant messaging as well as a variety of indirect formats such as email, self-help apps, or websites (Luxton, Nelson, et al., 2016). In this article, telepsychology is more narrowly defined as the use of videoconferencing and telephone technologies to provide mental health services in order to reflect that the bulk of the available research is conducted using one of these two mediums. There are also a number of terms presented in the literature that are interchangeable with the term telepsychology such as telehealth, telemental health, telebehavioral health, teletherapy, telepsychotherapy, etc. (Luxton, Nelson, et al., 2016).Telepsychology is often viewed as a potential solution for increasing access to treatment, increasing privacy, and reducing exposure to the negative stigma associated with seeking treatment for veterans (Chen et al., 2019 [videoconferencing]; Turgoose et al., 2018 [videoconferencing and phone]). For example, telepsychology can allow veterans to use an internet-connected device, such as a computer, in the comfort of their own home or in a local office setting to meet with their provider who may be located across the country by videoconference or phone. Participating in telepsychology increases privacy associated with seeking mental health services by eliminating the need to sit in a lobby with other veterans while waiting for a mental health provider appointment. Furthermore, this increased privacy associated with telepsychology visits can help prevent some of the negative stigma or embarrassment that veterans might experience during face-to-face (FTF) visits by allowing them to avoid those in-office contacts.Effectiveness of TelepsychologyOne question that must be presented to mental health providers and researchers is whether veteran-focused telepsychology is at least as effective as treatment that is delivered FTF (Bolton & Dorstyn, 2015 [videoconferencing]; Turgoose et al., 2018 [videoconferencing and phone]). A growing number of studies have examined this question with some studies finding that telepsychology is effective and equivalent to services delivered FTF, whereas other studies have found mixed results (Turgoose et al., 2018 [videoconferencing and phone]). Telepsychology has generally been found to be an effective treatment delivery method for common mental health conditions experienced by veterans (Bolton & Dorstyn, 2015 [videoconferencing]; Turgoose et al., 2018 [videoconferencing and phone]) including the following: PTSD and other trauma and stressor-related disorders (Wierwille et al., 2016 [videoconferencing]), anxiety (Burke et al., 2019 [internet-delivered]; Yuen et al., 2013 [videoconferencing]), depression (Sztein et al., 2018 [internet-only]), intermittent explosive disorder (Osma et al., 2016 [videoconferencing]), substance use disorders (Wilks et al., 2017 [internet-only]), etc.For example, Wierwille et al. (2016) reported clinically significant reductions in trauma-related symptom in a sample of 221 veterans with PTSD after videoconferencing-delivered exposure therapy at posttest. In another study by Luxton, Pruitt, et al. (2016), 121 military service members and veterans were randomly assigned to receive 8 sessions of behavioral activation therapy for depression either through home-based videoconferencing or FTF visits. At posttest, both the home-based telepsychology and FTF participants demonstrated strong reductions in symptoms of depression and hopelessness, with the home-based group demonstrating a slight overall benefit. Veterans reported statistically significant, high satisfaction ratings suggesting that they were satisfied with treatment, regardless of whether the services were provided through home-based videoconferencing or FTF (Luxton, Nelson, et al., 2016).As the volume of telepsychology research has grown, review studies have been better able to answer the question of whether telepsychology is as effective as FTF services by examining findings from groups of studies that looked broadly at civilian samples (see Bolton & Dorstyn, 2015 [videoconferencing]; Sztein et al., 2018 [internet-only]; Turgoose et al., 2018 [videoconferencing and phone]). For example, Sztein et al. (2018) conducted a civilian-focused systematic review and meta-analysis with 14 studies that examined treatment outcomes for telepsychology-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy for depression. The authors reported a medium effect (d = 0.74; p < .001) at posttest with sustained reductions in symptoms of depression at 3- and 6-month follow-up in adults, which the authors noted were comparable to effect sizes commonly observed in FTF samples (Sztein et al., 2018 [internet-only]). Barak et al.’s (2008) was another civilian-focused meta-analytic study that broadly looked at mental health services provided through telepsychology. The authors reviewed 64 articles that included 9,764 total participants and reported a mean overall medium weighted effect size of d = 0.53 for services delivered through web-based interventions, which the authors noted is also comparable to effect sizes observed in FTF-delivered talk therapies (Barak et al., 2008). Bolton and Dorstyn (2015) looked specifically at the impact of videoconferencing-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy on the symptoms of depression, generalized anxiety, and PTSD in another civilian-focused systematic review. The authors reported significant medium to strong improvements (d range = 0.66–3.22) in symptoms across all conditions in both telepsychology and FTF conditions, but was unable to determine whether telepsychology and FTF-delivered treatments were equivalent (Bolton & Dorstyn, 2015).Our research only noted one review study that focused specifically on veterans. Turgoose et al. (2018) conducted a systematic review that included 41 studies that focused on the use of telepsychology (i.e., videoconferencing and phone) to treat veterans with PTSD. The authors noted that a majority of the studies reviewed found that PTSD treatment delivered by telepsychology was just as effective as PTSD treatments delivered FTF. The authors also noted that veterans participating in telepsychology reported high levels of acceptability and treatment satisfaction overall with services delivered through technology, with some studies suggesting that veterans were less comfortable with services delivered through technology. The authors also noted similar dropout rates for telepsychology and FTF treatments (Turgoose et al., 2018). One limitation of the systematic review, however, is that it is descriptive in nature and looks for trends in the studies reviewed, so it does not allow the author to answer statistical questions such as whether or not services delivered through technology are effective or equivalent to services delivered FTF.The Present StudyResearch on the effectiveness of telepsychology is growing, and both the quantity and quality of veteran-specific studies are expanding (Turgoose et al., 2018). A number of veteran-focused review studies are noted in the literature and those studies have generally found telepsychology to be as effective as services delivered FTF (see Bolton & Dorstyn, 2015; Sztein et al., 2018). Given the unique lived experiences of veterans and the increasing reliance on services delivered via telepsychology, more research is needed to determine whether telepsychology is as effective as services delivered FTF. The Turgoose et al. (2018) systematic review, which focused on PTSD, suggests that services delivered through telepsychology are as effective as services delivered FTF. A new review study, however, is needed to statistically evaluate the effectiveness of services provided by telepsychology for veterans. The present study seeks to add to the literature on the efficacy of telepsychology with veterans by using meta-analytic techniques to test whether telepsychology-based services are effective and whether they are equivalent to services delivered FTF. Furthermore, as technological methods of delivering therapy have evolved, the present study also seeks to examine the differences in the effectiveness of therapy delivered by videoconferencing versus phone.MethodResearch QuestionThe overall research question for this meta-analysis is “Is telepsychology effective for veteran populations?” There are three approaches to answering this question. First, is telepsychology effective across time when comparing pretest assessments to posttest and follow-up assessments? Second, is telepsychology effective compared to treatments as usual (TAU)? Furthermore, are there any differences between the two primary modalities of telepsychology, videoconferencing and phone?Inclusion and Exclusion CriteriaInitially, we broadly defined telepsychology as including mental health services delivered using technology. After reviewing the available literature, we elected to limit the telepsychology modality considered for inclusion in this study to synchronous videoconferencing and telephone. The literature on areas such as instant messaging, email, web apps, etc. with our focus population was too sparse and did not allow for a robust enough sample to be considered for inclusion.We defined veterans as former service members at the time the study was completed. We included studies that contained veterans and that met our other search criteria. Other inclusion criteria included empirical studies that reported findings of a therapeutic intervention delivered by videoconference or telephone. The intervention had to focus on delivering therapy to treat a psychological condition, as opposed to other purposes like screening, testing, assessing, or monitoring. The intervention also had to have a therapeutic component (e.g., reducing symptoms of depression) as opposed to being solely educational in nature. The most common conditions assessed in these studies were PTSD, depression, anger, and anxiety, although therapy for pain, quality of life, relationship satisfaction, sleep quality, hopelessness, overall mental health, psychological functioning, and smoking cessation were also present. Finally, the study had to report clinical outcomes of a psychological nature that included both a pretest and posttest data collection period. We excluded outcomes concerning feasibility, perceptions, satisfaction, and costs.Literature SearchThe research team initially looked for meta-analytic, systematic, and literature review studies for veteran samples to determine the types of review studies that had previously been completed. Then, we searched the reference lists of those articles for empirical studies that met our inclusion criteria. After we exhausted all review studies and their reference lists, the research team conducted a broader literature search using various combinations of the following search terms in the PsycInfo, MedLine, and CINAHL databases: telepsychology, telehealth, telemental health, telebehavioral health, teletherapy, telecounseling, tele, phone, videoconferencing, therapy, counseling, psychotherapy, veterans, treatment, disorder, and mental health. We continued this process of searching databases and back-searching reference lists until we were confident all of the relevant published studies had been located.Computing Effect SizesPractically, all outcome measures in this set of studies were scored such that higher values indicated worse psychological conditions and lower values indicated better psychological conditions. For example, high scores on the PTSD Checklist (PCL), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS), Symptom Checklist-90-Revised (SCL), Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ), etc. represent higher levels of psychological distress, so therapies that lower scores on these measures have desirable effects. Typically, these situations result in negative effect sizes (i.e., the posttest scores are lower than the pretest scores). However, we have reported positive effect sizes to reflect that psychological conditions improved as a result of the therapy.There were a few measures wherein higher values indicate better psychological conditions (e.g., QOLI, relationship quality, and satisfaction). We used positive effect sizes to indicate improvement in psychological conditions for these measures.Although some very good work has been done in developing appropriate metrics for meta-analyses, the data presented in the studies we reviewed do not permit that good work to be fully capitalized upon. Nearly all of the studies that were located reported pre–post comparisons, and the effect size for pre–post comparisons is the mean change score divided by the standard deviation of the change scores. Only one article reported these data (Fortney et al., 2015).More commonly, the articles reported the mean pre and postscores for the treatment group (and often a comparison group), and they reported the standard deviation for the pretest scores and the standard deviation for the posttest scores. Note that the standard deviation of the change scores is not simply the difference between the standard deviations of the pretest and posttest scores, nor is it the average of the standard deviations of the pretest and posttest scores.Pre–Post Effect SizeBecause this was the only data provided, we made use of it by computing the pre–post effect size (which can also be called the “within group effect size” or the “uncontrolled effect size”) by dividing the difference in pretest and posttest mean scores by the average standard deviation of the pretest and posttest scores.Randomized Clinical Trials Effect SizeSome studies used a true randomized clinical trial (RCT) design to allow for the testing of noninferiority or equivalence of telepsychology to the same therapy-administered FTF. In these designs, one group received therapy administered through telepsychology and a comparison group received the same therapy administered in a FTF format (the TAU group).To compute the effect size for these research designs, we computed a pre–post effect size for both the telepsychology group and the TAU group, and then, we subtracted the TAU group pre–post effect size from the telepsychology group pre–post effect size.Multiple Effect Sizes From StudiesOf the 27 studies, 22 of them reported results for more than one psychological outcome (e.g., Acierno et al., 2016, reported results using both the Beck Depression Inventory, which we categorized as depression, and the Patient Checklist, which we categorized as trauma). Because we analyzed the data by psychological outcome, each study could be included in the results more than once (e.g., the Acierno et al., 2016, study contributed an effect size for both trauma and depression). However, eight studies included two measures for the same psychological outcome (e.g., Aburizik et al., 2013, included both the Patient Health Questionnaire and the Beck Depression Inventory, both of which we categorized as measures of depression). In these cases, the effect sizes for the two measures of the same construct were averaged together before being included in the weighted average calculations. By doing this, we avoided the problem of double-counting these studies.Computing Weighted Average Effect SizesThe goal of meta-analysis is to determine the weighted average effect size for groups of studies that meet certain conditions. However, the process for computing the weighted average effect size differs slightly for the pre–post effect size compared to RCT designs.For pre–post effect sizes, the effect size from each study was weighted by the number of participants who completed the posttest.For the RCT designs, the effect size of each study was weighted by the inverse of the variance of the estimate. The inverse of the variance is highly dependent on the sample size, but it has better psychometric properties than simply using the sample size of each study.Pre–Post and Follow-Up DesignsAll of the studies included in this meta-analysis used at least a pre–post design such that measures of psychological states were collected twice. Many of the studies also included some sort of follow-up measurement after the posttest administration. The most common follow-up measurements were at 3 and 6 months after the posttest.In addition to computing the effect sizes for the pre–post comparisons, we also computed effect sizes for follow-ups when the data were provided in the article. The procedure for computing the follow-up effect sizes was exactly the same as the pre–post effect size, except that instead of using the posttest mean values and standard deviations, the follow-up mean values and standard deviations were used.ResultsDescriptive Results of Literature SearchA total of 27 published studies were located that met the inclusion criteria, and they contained 27 samples (see Table 1TABLES AND FIGUREStable/figure thumbnailTable 1. Description of Studies Included in the Meta-Analysis Organized by Author and Dependent Variable StudiedView larger image > in this page > in new window> Download slidefor a summary of the 27 studies included in the analysis organized by author last name and dependent variable studied). Of these 27 studies, 25 provided pre–post data, and 18 were RCT designs. (Of the seven pre–post studies, three also included a no-treatment wait-list control group, but the wait-list data were not considered.) Of the 27 studies, 19 of them examined more than one psychological outcome measure.Computing the number of participants in these studies was challenging. Not surprisingly, when therapy is being administered over the course of weeks and months, dropout from the studies is a problem. Sample sizes for pretest data were often greater than that for the posttest and follow-up data. Where reported, we used the sample size for the number of participants who were assessed at the posttest or follow-up measurements (see Table 1). The 30 samples used a total of 1,667 participants who received telepsychology (e.g., videoconferencing or telephone) and 981 participants who received FTF therapy in RCT designs.Publication Bias AssessmentPublication bias is a concern in meta-analysis because it is possible that only studies that show strong effects get published. When the conclusions of meta-analytic studies are based only on the studies with strong effect sizes, the outcome of the meta-analysis is biased.There is no definitive method for assessing publication bias, and there is also no definitive procedure for correcting for it. Of the assessments that have been developed, all have limitations (van Aert et al., 2019). However, one general assessment of publication bias is to compute the correlation between sample size and effect size. If this correlation is significant and negative, a tentative inference is that smaller studies are only published when they have stronger effects, resulting in bias in the meta-analytic conclusions.We computed the correlations between sample size and effect size for RCT designs measuring trauma and depression at posttest. These correlations are r = −.17 and .11 for k = 13 and 12 studies, p = .58 and.73, respectively.Similarly, we computed the correlations between sample size and effect size for all of the pre–post effect sizes for both trauma and depression. These correlations are r = −.34 and −.20 for k = 17 and 17 studies, p = .19 and .44, respectively.Although these nonsignificant correlations do not establish that there is no bias in our results, they are an indication that publication bias is not likely to be a strong influence. For psychological conditions other than trauma and depression, and for follow-up assessment months after the posttest, there were simply not enough effect sizes to make it meaningful to compute the correlations.Results of Meta-AnalysisRecall that we examined two different designs: pre–post and RCT. Most of the RCT designs also provided data that could be analyzed for pre–post analyses. To interpret the weighted average effect sizes, we used the guidelines suggested by Cohen (1988) wherein effect sizes in the range of 0.20, 0.50, and 0.80 are considered weak, moderate, and strong effects, respectively.For the pre–post designs, the results for each type of psychological problem are reported in Table 2,TABLES AND FIGUREStable/figure thumbnailTable 2. Summary Statistics for Various Mental Health Conditions in Meta-Analysis at Posttest, and 3- and 6-Month Following Treatment for Pre–Post StudiesView larger image > in this page > in new window> Download slidewhich shows the number of studies, the total number of participants in those studies, the weighted average effect size, and whether the study involved videoconferencing or phone. These results show the effect of telepsychology over time, without regards to any comparison group. Most of the effect sizes are in the moderate-to-strong range, and given that most of them are positive numbers, this result indicates that participants’ psychological well-being improved as a result of receiving services through telepsychology.For example, the two psychological conditions studied most frequently were trauma and depression. We used the guidelines suggested by Cohen (1988) to interpret the weighted average effect sizes. The average weighted effect sizes for trauma (d = 1.00 for videoconferencing and d = 0.51 for phone) and depression (d = 0.86 for videoconferencing and d = 0.44 for phone) across these studies fell into the moderate-to-strong range, and the positive values of the effect sizes indicate that participants’ psychological symptoms of trauma and depression improved from pretest to posttest. It is important to note that this is just improvement over time in the participants, and in this type of research design, there is no control or comparison group. Note that there is no way to compute the confidence intervals for these values because the formula for the confidence intervals depends on having the standard deviation of the difference scores, and this information has not been reported in the studies we located for this meta-analysis.For RCT designs, the results for each type of psychological problem are reported in Table 3,TABLES AND FIGUREStable/figure thumbnailTable 3. Summary Statistics for Various Mental Health Conditions in Meta-Analysis at Posttest and at 3- and 6-Month Following Treatment for Randomized Controlled Trial StudiesView larger image > in this page > in new window> Download slidewhich shows the number of studies, the total number of participants in those studies, the weighted average effect size, the 95% confidence interval for the weighted average effect size, and whether the study involved videoconferencing or phone. These results show the effect of telepsychology over time when compared to an equivalent FTF therapy. Strictly speaking, these are the results of the highest scientific value. Paradoxically, values close to 0.00 are a good thing; they indicate that telepsychology was as effective as services provided FTF. Positive values indicate that telepsychology was more effective than FTF therapy, and correspondingly, negative values indicate that FTF therapy was more effective than telepsychology.For example, consider the values for RCT studies for trauma and depression shown in Table 3. The weighted average effect sizes for trauma are d = −0.25 for videoconferencing and d = −0.34 for phone. The negative sign indicates that participants in the FTF condition improved over time more than those in the telepsychology condition. However, this is a small effect, and thus, it could be practically interpreted as telepsychology is comparably as effective as FTF treatment. Similarly, for depression, the weighted average effect sizes are d = 0.00 for videoconferencing and d = −0.09 for phone. Again, the negative sign indicates that the FTF group fared better than the telepsychology group. But, here again, the effect is very small; it is quite close to 0.00. For practical purposes, telepsychology was equivalent to FTF treatment.DiscussionOverall, the results of this meta-analysis suggest that telepsychology is comparable to FTF therapy for veterans dealing with a variety of psychological conditions. The pre–post comparisons suggest that videoconferencing-based telepsychology has moderate-to-strong effect sizes and telephone-based telepsychology has moderate effect sizes for the two psychological conditions studied most frequently (e.g., trauma and depression).The RCT designs allow for a more powerful conclusion to be drawn. In general, videoconferencing- and telephone-based telepsychology is practically equivalent to and FTF-delivered therapies. The effect sizes comparing telepsychology to FTF therapies are generally weak, indicating that there is little difference in the two modalities.ImplicationsThe present study is also unique in that it compared the two most frequently utilized modes of telepsychology, videoconferencing, and phone. It also extends the work of Turgoose et al. (2018) who described the literature on the effectiveness and equivalence of telepsychology on veterans and adds to the larger body of meta-analytic studies on the effectiveness and equivalence of telepsychology when compared to FTF treatment by applying the meta-analytic approach to veteran-related studies. Turgoose et al.’s (2018) systematic review noted that a majority of veteran-focused studies have found telepsychology to be an effective way of reducing psychological symptoms. That study also indicated that most studies have found that talk therapies delivered to veterans by telepsychology are as effective at reducing mental health symptoms as services that are delivered FTF (Turgoose et al., 2018). Our study extends Turgoose et al.’s findings by using meta-analytic techniques to quantitatively assess and subsequently support their conclusions related to the effectiveness and equivalence of telepsychology. In addition, to our knowledge, our study represents the first meta-analytic study to evaluate the effectiveness and equivalence of telepsychology at reducing mental health symptoms exclusively in veteran samples.In our study, we found that services delivered by telepsychology had a moderate-to-strong effect of reducing symptoms of PTSD and depression in veterans. This finding is similar to the effect sizes reported by other authors who have looked more broadly at the effect sizes of telepsychology for PTSD and depression (Bolton & Dorstyn, 2015; Coughtrey & Pistrang, 2018; Olthuis et al., 2016; Osenbach et al., 2013). For example, Bolton and Dorstyn (2015) reported findings that were similar to ours. Those authors found moderate-to-strong effects (d range = 0.66–3.22) for reductions in cognitive and behavioral symptoms of PTSD, depression, and generalized anxiety in a meta-analysis that included 11 studies and 474 total participants (Bolton & Dorstyn, 2015). Olthuis et al. (2016) reported similar effects for telepsychology for PTSD, d = 0.81. Collectively, these studies suggest that telepsychology-delivered services are an effective way of reducing symptoms of PTSD and depression.Our findings related to the equivalence of telepsychology compared to services delivered FTF with veterans was also comparable to that noted in previous research (Norwood et al., 2018; Osenbach et al., 2013). In the present study, we found services delivered via telepsychology to be equivalent to services delivered FTF (d range = −0.48 to 0.24). Norwood et al. (2018) reported a similar value of d of −0.03 when examining the noninferiority of telepsychology at reducing target mental health symptoms. And Osenbach et al. (2013) reported a d of −0.11 when comparing telepsychology to FTF treatments and a d of 0.29 when comparing telepsychology to TAU comparison groups.LimitationsTwo limitations are noted for the present study, as well as three limitations for the larger body of literature we reviewed. First, in the present study, we were able to locate a sufficient number of studies to assess the effectiveness as well as the equivalence of telepsychology versus FTF for PTSD and depression, especially at posttest for the pre–post and RCT studies (ranged from 12 to 17 studies per analysis). However, the number of studies available to us that examined other diagnostic conditions (e.g., anxiety, pain, sleep disorders, etc.) was minimal. We considered removing any analysis of those diagnostic conditions from our study; however, we elected to include them for documentation purposes to highlight what is currently known. Ideally, we would have a minimum of five studies for each diagnostic condition; we were simply unable to find enough studies for all of the conditions.Second, in the present study, just as we were only able to find a limited number of studies for all of the diagnostic conditions, studies with longitudinal data were limited. For example, we were able to locate 13 RCT studies that provided results at posttest for PTSD; however, only 4 of those studies provided 3-month follow-up data, and only 2 of those studies provided 6-month follow-up data. This lack of longitudinal data on the effectiveness of telepsychology for each of the diagnostic conditions means that our findings reported effect sizes for 3- and 6-month follow-up that are based on limited data. Ideally, our analysis would include a minimum of five studies for each diagnostic condition at 3- and 6-month follow-up.We also noted three limitations related to our review of the larger body of veteran-focused telepsychology literature. First, more RCTs are needed for all diagnostic conditions, especially for diagnostic conditions other than PTSD and depression. For example, we noted no RCTs that targeted substance use disorders and only one or two studies that addressed symptoms of anxiety or pain. To some extent, this makes sense because PTSD and depression are two of the most common mental health problems that veterans experience. However, veterans face a number of mental health problems that telepsychology might be helpful in addressing.Second, very few of the veteran-focused telepsychology studies we identified provided demographic or outcome data on the race, gender, or geographic makeup of their participants. These data could be helpful in determining whether traditionally underserved veteran subpopulations, such as rural, women, and/or veterans of color populations, for example, are experiencing similar levels of efficacy compared to the average participant.Finally, we noted few veteran-focused telepsychology studies that used samples outside of North America, and especially the United States. Are telepsychology-delivered services as effective as, and are those services equivalent to FTF-delivered treatments that are provided to veterans in other areas of the world?Future DirectionsBased on the limitations noted above, both for the present study as well as the larger body of telepsychology-focused research, we offer six suggestions for the future research. First, more studies, especially RCTs that look at diagnostic conditions other than PTSD and depression, are needed. Individual studies in the larger body of telepsychology literature (i.e., veteran and all other populations) have looked at the efficacy of telepsychology for psychological disorders ranging from substance use disorders, anxiety, and obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) to more chronic forms of mental illness including bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. Similar or enhanced versions of these studies should be considered for veterans. Second, future studies should include more follow-up data on research participants. In the present study, follow-up data were most commonly presented at posttest and then at 3- and 6-month posttreatment. Future studies that include this type of follow-up data would allow us to better understand the long-term efficacy of telepsychology with veterans. Third, future studies should include technology modality as a moderator variable to allow us to better understand whether specific types of telepsychology-based services (e.g., videoconferencing vs. telephone) are more effective with veterans than other modalities.Fourth, too few veteran-focused studies related to web apps, email, computer-only, and text messaging or instant chat to consider adding them to the present study. As this body of literature expands, more work needs to be done to better understand the role of these other, less often researched modalities of telepsychology to verify whether and/or under what circumstances these other technologies can be effective methods of providing services using meta-analytic techniques. Fifth, more effort needs to be made to describe sample characteristics such as the race, gender, and geographic location of veteran research participants as well as outcome data on specific veteran subpopulations (e.g., veterans of color). Including these sample characteristics and providing outcome data on these special populations will help future researchers better assess whether the benefits of telepsychology are being experienced by all veterans. Finally, the future research should focus on studying the efficacy of veteran populations outside of North America. Generally, more work must be done to close the gap between veterans who need mental health services and those who receive these services. The present study suggests that telepsychology, especially videoconferencing, and phone whenever videoconferencing is not available, can play an important role in addressing mental health service disparities for veterans. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the child custody evaluation (CCE) community has been astounding and immediate. In March, April, and May of 2020, state and local governments and courts began issuing safe-at-home and social distancing proclamations. Provision of in-person mental health services was discouraged as unsafe (Chenneville & Schwartz-Mette, 2020). These pronouncements required evaluators to quickly learn what technology could be used and how to use it to finish incomplete evaluations or meet the demands of court orders for new evaluations. While the capability of providing behavioral health services with telecommunication technologies has been extended to virtually all clinical aspects of behavioral and mental health practice, such as assessment, consultation, psychoeducation, and treatment (Luxton, Nelson, & Maheu, 2016), utilizing these technologies in parenting plan evaluations had not been a serious topic prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. That has changed. This article examines the feasibility of remote child custody evaluations (RCCEs) both during the pandemic and beyond.The COVID-19 pandemic has pushed an entire professional community to consider whether videoconferencing (VC) can be paired with custody methods and procedures to produce valid, reliable, and trustworthy results. For each component methodology of a comprehensive CCE that would usually require in-person contact, the best practices for using VC and the available empirical research are used to illustrate when VC is acceptable and when it is not. In a completely remote CCE, VC is used to conduct interviews of the adults and children, to conduct psychological testing (to the extent possible), and to conduct parent–child observations. RCCEs retain elements of in-person CCEs such as document retrieval and review and contacts with third-party collaterals—usually by telephone. In order to conduct an RCCE, an evaluator must be competent in both VC use in a professional relationship and in the methodological demands of properly conducting a CCE. However, not every task can be delivered via VC, not every case is appropriate for remote evaluation, not every party or child will agree to using the technology, and not every evaluator will embrace this new approach. Yet progress in a professional specialty like child custody, that looks to science for guidance, is often about generalizations where conclusions obtained in a laboratory or slightly alternative setting are developed, then transported and applied elsewhere in environments that may differ from that in the laboratory or alternative setting (Pearl & Bareinboim, 2014). This is an opportunity to do just that.This effort is not an attempt to fundamentally alter current CCE processes but to extrapolate and accept the lessons learned about VC use in other areas of psychology in the CCE context. Using VC can enable RCCEs to be viewed as an alternative with an array of possible applications, including situations where COVID-19 or other issues require social distancing, as well as situations where other factors (e.g., access to justice, financial considerations, and resource availability) otherwise limit the choices available to families and the court. It is also possible that a family could choose to have their evaluation conducted remotely using VC for reasons entirely their own.These issues are of interest to evaluators making decisions about whether to use VC and to conduct RCCEs. These issues are of interest to attorneys as they advise and represent their clients in various contexts including but not limited to litigation. These issues are also of interest to courts and judges who must decide whether an RCCE will help the court, under what circumstances this approach may or may not work, and how to weigh the data generated via VC. Finally, these issues are also of interest to the parties—and ultimately their children—as they weigh the considerations and factors associated with various dispute resolution alternatives and, when necessary, their access to the authority of the court for problem solving.A Conceptual Model for RCCEsChild custody evaluation may be the most complex and difficult type of forensic evaluation. In contrast to most examinations in which one person is evaluated, in the typical child custody evaluation, the mental health professional examines a number of persons (e.g., mother, father, child or children, and potential or actual stepparents). Additionally, given the expansive nature of the underlying psycholegal issues (i.e., the best interests of the children and the ability of the parents to meet those interests), the examinees must be assessed regarding a variety of behaviors, capacities, and needs. Finally, because the stakes are so significant (i.e., residential placement of the children and decision-making authority with respect to their welfare), emotions in cases of contested custody typically run high, further compounding what is an already complicated evaluation process. (Otto, Edens, & Barcus, 2000, pp. 312–313)Competent child custody evaluators, both those conducting in-person CCEs as well as those performing RCCEs, must operationalize the best interests task and objectives, understand how multiple methods are used to gather data on factors and psycholegal questions, and know how to use the multitrait-multimethod matrix interpretation principles of data analysis. The behaviors of the parties and their children and their relationships usually have multiple determinants. There may be few, if any, linear or simple cause-and-effect relationships.Complex custody disputes almost always involve not just one theory or question but multiple questions and competing theories about highly disputed facts (Dale & Gould, 2014). For the evaluator, these factual disputes require formulating, hypothesizing, and developing opinions to numerous series of questions that are often subsumed under multiple main questions.Determining what is in the best interests of the child involves answering numerous subquestions about child factors, interfamilial and parenting factors, parent factors, and extrafamilial factors (citation omitted). Each of these factors is composed of subfactors that address separate factual questions about how the age of the child, the child’s gender, and the child’s cognitive and emotional development will affect current and future parent–child interactions and functioning (Krauss & Sales, 1999, p. 96).In addition, evaluators must recognize any CCE is an assessment of multiple moving targets; people, their circumstances, and their situations may be in a constant state of change in response to the separation or other aspects of the ongoing dispute. Articulating a conceptual lens is necessary because of how much the evaluator must adapt the methodological elements as the evaluation proceeds. The evaluator manages a process that must assess and investigate required topics, be responsive to opportunities for additional details—which may emerge at any point in the process—and adjust inquiries as the data confirms or disconfirms various hypotheses.The process of any evaluation, whether conducted in person or via VC, is dependent upon a perpetual adaptation of the evaluator’s ability to operationalize best interests considerations and questions, the evaluator’s competence in the use of each of the multiple methods of data collection, and the evaluator’s ability to integrate large amounts of data into a comprehensive understanding of the issues in the case. While there are scientific principles to guide portions of the work, a CCE is still a fact-intensive inquiry and investigation using multiple methods to seek an individualized answer. Diligently applying the conceptual model, the multitrait-multimethod data analysis, and the investigative mindset is the evaluator’s best defense against missing something, against challenges of possible biases, or against performing a less than adequate evaluation.Scope of a CCE: Best Interests Factors and Case-Specific Psycholegal QuestionsIn CCEs, evaluators collect data and facts that are used to develop opinions about relevant factors or psycholegal questions, including opinions about the ultimate issues of custody, residency, and parenting time. In making a best interests determination, courts must consider all the factors that may be identified by statute or case law, as well as any relevant factors raised by the parties. If offering an opinion on the ultimate issues of custody and parenting time, evaluators are also expected to consider these factors, and when possible and appropriate, evaluators may use social science research to support their choice of methods, inferences, and opinions.Evaluators are also encouraged to develop case-specific psycholegal questions to guide their inquiry. “The relevance of the information gathered in the evaluation is directly tied to the clarity and scope of the questions that guide the investigation” (Gould & Martindale, 2009, p. 1). “Clearly defined questions lead the evaluator to choose methods of assessment that measure behaviors directly relevant to questions of concern to the court” (Gould & Martindale, 2007, p. 101). By including specific questions in court orders or stipulations, judges and attorneys increase the likelihood that evaluators will stay on course, investigate the issues of concern, and, in preparing their reports, provide information that bears directly upon the issues before the court (Gould & Martindale, 2009). This process requires considerable pre-evaluation preparation.Child custody evaluators are often asked to evaluate allegations of risky and/or abusive behaviors such as domestic or intimate partner violence, child sexual abuse, various forms of child maltreatment, or claims of parental alienation or alienated children, as well as a multitude of other behaviors believed to place children at risk for harm, neglect, or adjustment problems. Efforts to assess the historical truth of an allegation, for example, usually involve interviewing all of the involved parties and combining this data with information from relevant records or information from other third-party informants.Multiple Methods of Data Collection: Five Types of Data CollectionIn conducting comprehensive child custody evaluations, evaluators apply theory, research, and scientific methodology (Drozd, Oleson, & Saini, 2013). Evaluators seek information from five types of independent data sources: (a) document or record review; (b) interviews, including individual interviews of the parties and, when appropriate, the children, as well as joint and group interviews, when appropriate; (c) psychological testing; (d) direct observations of parent–child relationships via home or office visits; and (e) contacts with collateral sources or witnesses. VC can be used to collect information from several of these data sources, including interviews, observations, and, in some instances, psychological testing.Before proceeding, it is important to recognize that agreement about these types of data collection does not always translate into agreement about the actual methodologies that are used. Different evaluators collect different data, and different evaluators may assign different weight to data (Gould, Kirkpatrick, Austin, & Martindale, 2004, p. 39). Some evaluators may rely differently on different portions of the evaluation in developing their hypotheses and opinions. For example, nonpsychologists are less likely to include psychological testing in their evaluation procedures. These evaluators must answer the same questions but may use records, interviews, observations, and contacts with collaterals to address the questions for which a psychologist uses testing. Evaluators unable to effectively use one methodology (e.g., testing) will be expected to develop ways to investigate issues using tools within their competence. The shortcomings of any individual data collection tool require the evaluator to design methods of investigating the relevant issue in other ways. The evaluator’s approach throughout the evaluation process involves choices. For each important issue or data point, does the evaluator immediately query and follow up or accept an answer in order to move on? Does the evaluator compare data or a fact to a claim or hypothesis and again query and challenge, or do they accept and move on?Conducting in-person interviews, observations, or psychological testing does not guarantee that the evaluator will produce a valid, reliable, or trustworthy work product. Poorly conducted interviews, psychological testing, or observations will likely result in unreliable results. In fact, there often exists as much disagreement as agreement about how each of these methods should be used in evaluations that are conducted in person. Evaluators may differ on how much historical data they collect or on how to weigh this information. With respect to interview techniques, for example, there may be agreement concerning the essential objectives of interviews with parents and with children, but there are disagreements about the degree that these interviews should be structured, with some claiming superiority of structured or semistructured interviews over unstructured interviews (Martindale & Gould, 2004). While many trumpet the importance of parent–child observations, there is no agreed-upon technique or procedure for how to do these observations in CCEs, a fact that raises serious questions about the ecological validity of any inferences based upon any individual evaluator’s parent–child observation procedures (Saini & Polak, 2014). In addition, in response to claims about the inappropriate use of psychological testing in CCEs, the response of a group of evaluators acknowledged problems yet outlined how properly conducted psychological testing can make unique, relevant, and reliable contributions in custody disputes (Rappaport, Gould, & Dale, 2018).The record keeping of evaluators can become an issue. Some have claimed forensic evaluators have a heightened duty to document their work. Some evaluators take copious notes, while others contemporaneously type questions and answers into a computer during interviews. Some evaluators audio record interviews, and others do not. Currently, evaluators who choose to record must have written permission of the parties. It is unclear, however, whether the parents could provide permission for the evaluator to record a child or whether an attorney or some other kind of representative would be needed to assist a child in making the decision about consent to the evaluator recording such contacts. While the forensic interviews of small children in child protection cases are routinely video and audio recorded, this is not standard practice in CCEs. In other areas of the law, evaluators have generally not been required to record forensic interviews without a showing of exception circumstances (see Holland v. United States, 1988 for a review of the case law regarding this issue in Rule 35 examinations). In addition, in order to avoid unequal treatment of evaluators, any requirement to record RCCEs would probably require that all CCEs, including face-to-face evaluations, be recorded. For a myriad of reasons that are beyond the scope of this article, we view such a proposition as highly unlikely.The Multitrait-Multimethod Matrix: Data Analysis and InterpretationIn managing their data collection, constructing hypotheses, and developing conclusions or opinions about the factors and psycholegal questions, evaluators have applied the multitrait-multimethod matrix, triangulation strategies, and the concepts of convergent and discriminant validity. In CCEs (and RCCEs), the multitrait-multimethod matrix refers to use of multiple data collection methods and a process for analyzing the data (Campbell & Fiske, 1959). This method recognizes that the behaviors and competencies of individuals are multiply determined (Wälder, 1936) and that the study of complex phenomena requires an active process of developing possible hypotheses and inferences from an evolving data set. Within this process, evaluators seek to avoid bias by maintaining even hovering attention to these multiple hypotheses (Freud, 1912), remaining vigilant to established methods and protocols that they have established, and adjusting the hypotheses as new data and issues are collected. Any deficiency in data collection in one area can be remedied by additional inquiry or by applying a different methodology to get that information. The multitrait-multimethod approach is the evaluator’s best defense against claims of bias or overreliance on simple answers to complex questions (Neal & Brodsky, 2016).Data analysis strategies using the multitrait-multimethod matrix heavily rely upon triangulation (Austin & Kirkpatrick, 2004). Triangulation involves using more than one approach or more than one data source to study, in this instance, a factor or question. Triangulation enhances reliability and validity by cross-checking or cross-referencing data or by combining different perceptions of the same event to provide a more robust and holistic picture (Vidovich, 2003). Triangulation also includes cross-checking data from multiple methods, sources, theories, and/or data types in order to get a more detailed and balanced picture of the situation (Altrichter, Feldman, Posch, & Somekh, 2008). The term “convergent validation” is used to describe when data from independent procedures support or validate the same conclusion or opinion, and the term “discriminant validation” is used to describe when data from independent procedures fail to support the same conclusions or opinions (Campbell & Fiske, 1959). There also may be times when evaluators must explain seemingly divergent data.CCEs also usually involve one or more hypothesis or theory about the meaning of various facts and events in the case. “Forensic practitioners ordinarily avoid relying solely on one source of data, and corroborate important data whenever feasible” (American Psychological Association [APA], 2013b, p. 15). In addition, while unique facts can be disclosed or discovered during any part of a CCE, there is generally no one-to-one correspondence between any single evaluation methodology and any best interests factor or psycholegal question. This is especially true when evaluating various kinds of competencies (e.g., parenting competence), where data from multiple sources are relevant.Evaluating each hypothesis or theory involves a combination of scientific and clinical thinking (Milchman, 2015). The scientific method calls for testing alternative hypotheses or theories and collecting evidence that confirms or disconfirms either an individual hypothesis or unifying theory. Coherence-based reasoning also applies to the evaluator’s data analyses as one attempts to integrate numerous, complex, and sometimes contradictory inferences into a coherent theory about the case (Charman, Douglass, & Mook, 2019). Understanding the implications of any particular hypothesis or theory and the interrelationships between the data and facts of the case is central to determining whether any fact confirms, disconfirms, supports, or disproves that particular hypothesis or theory.Child custody evaluators attempt to combine two sets of skills that are often presented as opposite extremes: the empirically minded psychometrician and the self-aware clinician. The extremes of this artificial and largely academic debate are captured in the following quote:In psychometric testing the examiner is seen as a source of error or bias, therefore his role is standardized and minimized, if not eliminated. By contrast, in clinical testing the role of the examiner is maximized: the examiner’s skill, judgment, and intuitive sensitivity are not only valued but are also regarded as the most sensitive and perceptive clinical tools available. The variety of interactional reactions that arise in the patient-examiner relationship are neither avoided nor acted upon; rather, they are identified and observed and then used as valuable aids in bringing greater meaning and understanding to the patient’s behavior and attitudes Clinicians should at all times be able to point to the data from which they draw their conclusions and also to trace out explicitly the chain of inferences that led to those conclusions. (Lerner, 1976, p. 7)In sum, each evaluator must design a study of the best interests factors and the psycholegal questions that are relevant to each case. There are both common elements to every CCE and unique, case-specific elements to every CCE. The approach is not totally experimental. Whereas scientific experiments seek to eliminate or minimize experimenter bias through methodological design, the custody evaluator’s task is to manage a dynamic process while remaining balanced, objective, and as free as possible from bias.The Substitutability of VC: Process ConsiderationsDemonstrating the substitutability of VC for face-to-face procedures can be done through comparisons of two interpersonal process variables and two outcome variables. The two process variables central to CCEs are empathic accuracy and the working alliance. The two outcome variables are positive therapy outcome (e.g., task completion) and studies demonstrating the equivalence of telemental health services provided by VC with those provided face to face.Empathic Accuracy and the Primary of Auditory and Visual Behaviors Over Nonverbal CuesMany evaluators are concerned that using VC and conducting RCCEs will result in a reduction in what has been termed “empathic accuracy.” Empathic accuracy is “the ability to perceive accurately how another person is feeling” (Levenson & Ruef, 1992, p. 234). Empathic accuracy is commonly operationalized as the correspondence between the thoughts and feelings people report experiencing and the thoughts and feelings that perceivers infer from the target’s behaviors (Ickes, Bissonnette, Garcia, & Stinson, 1990). Empathic accuracy is a relevant process variable because it is central to effective service delivery in both clinical and forensic psychology. It is an indication of emotional intelligence, and it is a clearly desirable skill for forensic evaluators (Brodsky & Wilson, 2013; Franklin, 2013). Even those with concerns about the uses of expressive empathy by evaluators agree that “empathic understanding” is an important element of forensic assessment (Greenberg & Shuman, 1997, p. 53). Certainly, some level of empathy is necessary for completion of a thorough assessment. While one research study found no significant differences in evaluee disclosures or uses of impression management (e.g., lying) when evaluators actively used expressive empathy versus when evaluators did not use expressive empathy (Vera et al., 2019), evaluators who come across as cold and callous risk discouraging evaluees from being thorough and honest (Franklin, 2013). Many have argued that the internal reaction of forensic evaluators may provide valuable information, if properly used (Erard & Pickar, 2008; Mulay, Mivshek, Kaufman, & Waugh, 2018; Pickar & Erard, 2008).Empathic accuracy generally depends on visual, auditory, and semantic information—a great deal of which is available through a VC interview. While it is certainly true that people express much of their emotion life in nonverbal behavior (Mehrabian, 1970; Mehrabian, 1981), the proper response in a forensic evaluation to potentially relevant nonverbal behavior is verbal inquiry into possible explanations of what has been observed, not interpretations that are uninformed by an appropriate query. The forensic evaluator’s focus on accuracy should lead to follow-up inquiry into observations of potentially relevant nonverbal behavior with the goal of making explicit potentially relevant emotions, their meaning, and their relevance to the legal questions being investigated.Studies have found that verbal and contextual cues have more value than nonverbal cues, a fact that supports the necessity of inquiry into possible emotional states associated with nonverbal cues identified by evaluators. Studies of empathic accuracy as an interpersonal process have explored the types of informational cues (i.e., facial expressions or semantic information) that lead others to be able to “read” their emotional expressions (Zaki, Bolger, & Ochsner, 2009). When contextual information is available, empathy accuracy has been shown to be primarily dependent upon verbal and contextual cues rather than nonverbal cues (Gesn & Ickes, 1999; Zaki et al., 2009). Immediate contextual cues (the verbal and nonverbal behaviors that precede each reported thought or feeling) and the cumulative contextual cues (the emergent meaning context that develops as a function of the temporal nature of an interaction) allow one to infer the specific content of a target person’s successive thoughts and feelings (Gesn & Ickes, 1999). Studies have also found that nonverbal expressive people are more “readable” than nonverbal, nonexpressive people (Zaki et al., 2009). Empathic accuracy increases when perceivers have access to both auditory and visual information rather than only auditory or only visual information (Zaki et al., 2009). In RCCEs, evaluators who observe nonverbal behavior should inquire as to the possible thoughts and emotions that the nonverbal behavior reflects.The desire to actually observe and see all nonverbal behavior is related to concerns about deception and “truth bias.” Truth bias refers to the fact that many individuals believe they can detect deception (Hancock, Woodworth, & Goorha, 2010). Every time new technologies are developed that allow people to communicate at a distance, from the telephone to the telegraph to the invention of the alphabet, the public has registered concerns about increases in lying (see Hancock, 2007). The “cue-availability heuristic” refers to the notion that when there are fewer cues, people might lie more often (Toma & Hancock, 2012). This notion asserts that people might lie more often because there are no nonverbal cues to be detected, and therefore, they are less likely to be discovered than they are in face-to-face interactions (Hancock & Woodworth, 2013). Unfortunately, studies have shown that very few people are good at detecting deceit in interpersonal interactions (Porter, Woodworth, & Birt, 2000). As previously described, inquiry into nonverbal behaviors and the disciplined use of the procedures in the conceptual model are designed to address these concerns to the extent that this is possible.Indeed, one small study of the effects of telepsychology format on empathic accuracy and therapeutic alliance found no significant differences on these variables in a comparison of VC, telephone, and face-to-face psychotherapy (Reese et al., 2016). Because the clients in this study received only one session of psychotherapy, these results must be considered preliminary, but they are encouraging. However, because we view empathy accuracy as a principle component of successful therapy, the evidence for successful teletherapy also should be viewed as evidence that empathy accuracy is possible through VC. This research is reviewed in this article.Working Alliance: Maximizing Data Gathering and Completing the Tasks of the EvaluationThe use of empathy in professional relationships is closely connected to the concept of a working alliance. The use of empathy in forensic evaluations may have varying levels of appropriateness, depending upon the nature of the evaluation and the setting in which the evaluation occurs. To the extent it is realistic, an assessment-based working alliance that fosters openness and acceptance should improve the assessment product (Mulay et al., 2018). While there are differences between the working alliance in therapy and in forensic assessment, we again assert that the research on the effectiveness of telemental health procedures should be viewed as evidence that forming a working alliance through VC is possible and achievable.There may be differences in the working alliance in therapy and the working alliance in CCEs, but there are also numerous similarities. In therapeutic relationships, the working alliance concept includes the emotional bond between the client and therapist, the quality of the client and therapist involvement in the tasks of therapy, and the amount of concordance on goals between the therapist and client (Bordin, 1979). In therapeutic relationships, the working or therapeutic alliance is a central “causal ingredient of change” (Henry, Strupp, Schacht, & Gaston, 1994, p. 485).In studies of the effectiveness of teletherapy that have found positive and equivalent outcomes, it seems safe to assume the therapists were able to develop successful working and therapeutic alliances. The ability for therapists to establish a working alliance via VC was also demonstrated in a study directly comparing the working alliances of the therapy processes and outcomes of clients randomly assigned to face-to-face, telephone, and VC. This study found no differences on either the working alliance or the outcome variables between the clients receiving services in different ways (Day & Schneider, 2002). In addition, this same study also found that client participation was significantly higher in distance modes (e.g., VC and telephone) than when face to face with their therapists. The researchers speculated that clients in the distance modes made more of an effort to communicate, that they took more responsibility for the interaction, or that distance made openness seem safer (Day & Schneider, 2002).The working alliance in a forensic CCE is different, but it still involves developing a working alliance. There is a consensus that forensic evaluators should refrain from developing or creating the impression of a helping or therapeutic relationship. The evaluator’s job is to help the court, but this is impossible to do without attending to and developing the evaluator-examinee relationship enough to achieve the goals of learning each party’s parenting plan proposal and investigating the factors or questions that have been identified for evaluation. Whether one argues against empathy in forensic evaluations in the interest of objectivity (e.g., Shuman, 1993) or for moderate empathy in the interest of objectivity (e.g., Brodsky & Wilson, 2013), evaluations involve gathering information from multiple sources. At a minimum, conveying respect for the other person and behaving in a culturally competent, ethical, polite, and professional manner remains a necessary aspect of any evaluator’s behavior (Brodsky & Wilson, 2013). Evaluators who keep a substantial interpersonal distance may be likely to receive truncated information (Jourard, 1971).A certain level of cooperation is particularly important in RCCEs. Using VC technology for RCCEs is likely a more valid and reliable procedure when the parties agree to its use. Generally, the validity of any psychological assessment is modulated by the degree to which the person being assessed accepts (i.e., is willing to participate in) the context of a given assessment including the setting and the manner in which the assessment is conducted. An individual’s acceptance of a particular type of assessment is a multifaceted construct that depends on an individual’s physical and emotional state, motivation, attention, personality, and temperament (Luxton et al., 2016). Poor acceptance has been cited as a factor that reduces compliance and the motivation to engage in mental health assessments (Rogers, 2001). Inadequate acceptance of telemental health by either the patient or practitioner can therefore be expected to have a negative influence on the validity and reliability of psychological assessments (Luxton, Pruitt, & Osenbach, 2014, p. 28).Some level of cooperation from the parties is necessary to do an RCCE because elements of the evaluation occur in unsupervised settings.Provision of telemental health services in professionally unsupervised settings requires that the patient take a more active and cooperative role in the . . . process than in in-person settings. Determining whether a patient [interviewee, added] can handle such demands may be more dependent on the patient’s organizational and cognitive capacities, than on diagnosis. (Turvey et al., 2013, p. 10)To help assure the validity and reliability of remote assessment, it is necessary to make sure the environmental conditions at the remote location are conducive to the assessment procedures. Ideally, the room would be set up according to the foci of the session (Gloff, LeNoue, Novins, & Myers, 2015, p. 518).Many patients and families report high satisfaction with telemental health. Reasons for this include (a) conveniently finding high-quality services close to home, (b) decreasing time away from both work and school, (c) decreasing costs associated with traveling miles for care, (d) decreasing stresses of travel with a child with a behavior disorder and siblings, (e) decreasing worries about navigating unfamiliar health care settings, (f) allowing additional supporters to attend and work together to coordinate care, and (g) decreasing stigma by connecting to child-friendly settings such as schools (Gloff et al., 2015; Nelson, Cain, & Sharp, 2017). These same dynamics might apply to the participants in RCCEs.The Substitutability of VC: The Empirical Outcome and Equivalence EvidenceThe use of technologies in mental health and psychological practice has steadily increased over the last decade (Luxton et al., 2014) because studies of the technology demonstrate it can be effectively used to achieve positive, equivalent outcomes. The principles and procedures used for psychological assessment and evaluation during treatment services (i.e., diagnosis and symptom assessment) are pertinent to other remote assessment and testing applications including neuropsychological and cognitive testing, forensic risk assessment, and occupational testing (Luxton et al., 2014). This section reviews the evidence base for telemental health procedures across adult and child populations, assessment and treatment tasks, and numerous clinical and forensic conditions. The authors assert that the consistently positive outcomes and demonstrated equivalence found in these studies support the notion that child custody evaluators, like therapists and other clinical and forensic evaluators, can develop empathic accuracy and working alliances sufficient to produce valid, reliable, and trustworthy child custody evaluations for the courts.VC in Psychotherapy With AdultsThe consensus at this point is that there is sufficient data of efficacy of telepsychology and a lack of data that it is inferior that there is no basis for overriding the choice of an informed client and competent therapist that this is an acceptable alternative under the right circumstances. (Harris, 2019, slide number, 47)Numerous reviews of the existing research document the feasibility of using VC in psychotherapy with adults. In a systematic literature review of 65 studies across psychotherapy modalities regarding the use of VC psychotherapy (VCP), 10 questions were addressed, including what therapeutic types/formats have used VC, in what populations VCP has been used, the number and types of publications related to VCP, and available satisfaction, feasibility, and outcome data related to VCP (Backhaus et al., 2012). The results indicate that VCP is feasible, has been used in a variety of therapeutic formats and with diverse populations, is generally associated with good user satisfaction, and is found to have similar clinical outcomes to traditional face-to-face psychotherapy (Backhaus et al., 2012). Another review of 26 studies of VC and cognitive–behavioral therapy concluded that the majority of the studies supported the effectiveness of using VC to deliver psychotherapy (Gros et al., 2013).Recent large randomized controlled trials demonstrate effectiveness of telemental health, with many smaller trials also supporting this conclusion. Regarding specific subgroups, such as patients with psychotic or phobic disorders, one review found no evidence for inferiority of VC telemental health for patients with psychosis (Sharp, Kobak, & Osman, 2011). Another study with psychotic patients compared in-person versus VC interviews and concluded that even patients with delusions pertaining to the TV appropriately responded to VC and did not incorporate their experiences into their delusional system (Dongier, Tempier, Lalinec-Michaud, & Meunier, 1986). A small study comparing in-person versus VC-based treatment for panic disorder with agoraphobia found equal effectiveness (Bouchard et al., 2004).VC in Forensic Settings: Clinical, Civil Commitment, and Competence AssessmentsVC has been used for psychiatric and forensic assessments in corrections environments around the world. In a study of 72 inpatients at a maximum security forensic unit of a state hospital in Washington found good to excellent reliabilities when comparing in-person with VC administrations of the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale-Anchored Version and the MacArthur Competence Assessment Tool-Criminal Adjudication (Lexcen, Hawk, Herrick, & Blank, 2006). A study of 21 forensic psychiatric inpatients comparing live interviews to VC interviews using the Georgia Court Competency Test found high levels of agreement between the interviewers (Manguno-Mire et al., 2007). In a study of 190 youth in juvenile detention, telemental health services were found to be associated with youth attaining goals and improving family relations during their incarceration (Fox, Connor, McCullers, & Waters, 2008).VC has been used to provide forensic opinions in court on mentally disordered offenders in Western Australia (Sullivan, Chapman, & Mullen, 2008) and in involuntary commitment proceedings in rural Australia (Yellowlees, 1997). VC has been used by psychiatrists in the United Kingdom to conduct gate-keeping assessments, prepare psychiatric court reports, and provide courtroom testimony for the criminal and civil courts (Khalifa, Saleem, & Stankard, 2008, pp. 6–8).VC in Neuropsychological AssessmentsMuch of the research on the use of VC in test administration originates in neuropsychology (or what is now termed “teleneuropsychology”; Grosch, Gottlieb, & Cullum, 2011). A meta-analytic review of 12 studies of VC-delivered neuropsychological tests found “support for the use of videoconferencing technology in the remote administration of neuropsychological tests, particularly those that rely upon verbal responses from participants” (Brearly et al., 2017, p. 184).Neuropsychological tests relying upon verbal instructions and responses are particularly well suited to VC administration, and good agreement between VC and face-to-face testing has been found in a number of studies. For example, one study of VC-based neuropsychological assessment versus in-person assessment of subjects with or without cognitive impairment (i.e., dementia) found no significant differences and concluded VC-based neuropsychological testing is a valid and reliable alternative to face-to-face assessment using selected measures (Cullum, Hynan, Grosch, Parikh, & Weiner, 2014). Other research groups comparing clinical diagnostic interviewing conducted via VC and traditional face-to-face conditions has suggested generally good agreement in diagnosing a variety of conditions including dementia (Barton, Morris, Rothlind, & Yaffe, 2011) and Alzheimer’s disease (Loh, Donaldson, Flicker, Maher, & Goldswain, 2007).VC in Remote Psychological Personality Testing: No Research, But New GuidanceThere is currently no known empirical research on remote administration of measures of personality. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, however, test publishers quickly developed methods for remote administration of numerous measures used by evaluators. Tests now available for remote administration include but are not limited to the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) instruments, the Millon inventories, and the Personality Assessment Inventory. For other psychological tests such as the Rorschach, remote administration procedures have also been developed. Remote administration is also possible for instruments like the Behavior Assessment Scale for Children or the Connors Rating Scales, which typically have been given to parents for completion at home.Given these parameters, VC can be used in remote psychological testing in two ways. First, some research investigations, particularly with some of the cognitive and neuropsychological tests that were previously discussed, have demonstrated that psychologists can use VC to administer certain psychological tests. Some but not all psychological tests lend themselves to remote administration. Remote psychological testing also may be possible with the assistance of monitors or proctors who, in partnership with the psychologist, assist in the administration of the test items and tasks.Second, VC can be used to allow a monitor or the psychologist evaluator to monitor test administration. Remote administration of psychological tests must consider the potential impact of remote administration procedures on the validity and reliability of the results (Corey & Ben-Porath, 2020). Therefore, “although these professional practice guidelines provide little practical instruction on how to ensure adherence to applicable ethical standards when administering psychological tests remotely, they do highlight an issue that is fundamental to understanding the challenge in remote psychological testing” (Corey & Ben-Porath, 2020, p. 200). Guideline 7 states,When a psychological test or other assessment procedure is conducted via telepsychology, psychologists are encouraged to ensure that the integrity of the psychometric properties of the test or assessment procedure (e.g., reliability and validity) and the conditions of administration indicated in the test manual are preserved when adapted for use with such technologies. (APA, 2013a, p. 798)The emphasis when using VC is on preserving the conditions of administration outlined in the test manual, whether this is in direct test administration or monitoring of someone completing a self-report instrument. For example, in a section titled “Testing Conditions,” the MMPI-2 manual describes the following:The typical testing situation for administering the MMPI-2 requires adequate space at a table to lay out the test booklet and answer sheet, good lighting, a comfortable chair, and quiet surroundings free of intrusions and distractions. However, it is often not possible to provide an ideal testing environment. For example, the hardcover version makes it possible to take the test in a waiting room or while sitting up in a bed in a hospital ward. In such settings. Precautions must be taken to ensure that the person taking the test is not bothered by others in the room or offered gratuitous advice by fellow patients. It is generally permissible to let the individual take the test in several shorter sessions over a limited period of time, say before or after an interruption for routine procedures. (Butcher et al., 2001, p. 9)A Case Example of Remote MMPI-2 AdministrationIn the initial VC CCE interview between the evaluator, Father (at home in city 60 miles from evaluator), and Mother (at home in city 180 miles from evaluator), the evaluator reviewed the court order and evaluation procedures. The court order included a provision allowing the evaluator to use VC. The parties and their attorneys agreed to this order.After the evaluator’s initial joint interview with Father and Mother conducted via VC (using GoToMeeting, which is HIPAA compatible and securely encrypted), Father and Mother were directed to remain at their respective computers (where there is adequate lighting and a comfortable chair) with no one else around or in the room (e.g., distraction-free environment) to await an e-mail with a link to the portal through which they could complete the psychological testing. On his computer, the evaluator logged onto Pearson Q global and sent Father an e-mail, confirmed Father’s receipt of that e-mail, and confirmed that Father was able to connect to the Pearson website via the link in the e-mail in order to take the test. Father began the test. The evaluator and Mother went through the same procedure until Mother was connected to the Pearson website and taking the test.The evaluator remotely monitored Father and Mother via VC while they were taking the test. The evaluator silenced his audio input and intermittently closed the ability of Father and Mother to see him. However, Father and Mother were prohibited from shutting down their audio or visual inputs. Through this continuous supervision, the evaluator confirmed that Father and Mother took the test without any outside assistance or distractions. At the end of taking the test, Father and Mother each signed off the Pearson portal, and their test responses were sent to Pearson.The evaluator logged onto Pearson again, located the respective test protocols, and generated an MMPI-2 Extended Score Report for each test taker. In order to conduct the critical item review with Father, Mother was excused from the VC connection. She signed off. The evaluator and Father stayed connected, and the evaluator conducted his critical item interview. When this was completed, Father was instructed to sign off and did so. Mother was contacted by cell phone and instructed to sign back on to the conference. When she did, the evaluator completed a critical item interview with her.Telemental Health Evidence Base for Use of VC With Children and AdolescentsToday’s youth comfortably communicate with peers and family members using information and communication technologies such as Skype, WhatsApp, FaceTime, Facebook Messenger, and a host of others (Saini & Polak, 2014). Telemental health may be especially suited for youth who frequently use the technology and may positively respond to the personal space and feeling of control allowed by VC. Videoconferencing may also offer advantages in working with adolescents, including less self-consciousness, increased personal space, and decreased confidentiality concerns as the provider is outside of the local community (Myers et al., 2017).VC Use in Therapy With Children and AdolescentsTo be included as a feasible accommodation in an RCCE, evaluators interviewing children using VC must be able to establish rapport with the child, develop adequate cooperation, and develop an alliance sufficient to gather data and information on a wide variety of topics. Interviews of the children in custody disputes are a central, essential, and often required element of child custody evaluations (Ackerman & Pritzl, 2011; Bow & Quinnell, 2004). There exists a substantial literature on interviewing children in custody cases (Saywitz, Camparo, & Romanoff, 2010; Warshak, 2003). Information from these interviews informs the evaluator on several important issues. State statutes often have several child-related best interests factors that must be considered by the court. These factors include but are not limited to the child’s preferences, the child’s adjustment, and the parent–child relationship. The perspectives of children are also crucial to an assessment of the children’s needs, the parental capacities for meeting these needs, and the resulting fit (APA, 2010). While the use of children as witnesses can stir controversy, their accounts of events in the home or in the life of the family or various family members, as well as accounts of the behaviors of others, can be helpful to understanding various allegations, claims, and stories. While children do not normally expect to make the custody decisions, many children, particularly older children, want to be heard on the issues that affect them (Cashmore & Parkinson, 2008).Support for using VC interviews with children and adolescents in CCEs comes from multiple sources. In 2017, the American Telemedicine Association (ATA) developed the “Practice Guidelines for Telemental Health for Children and Adolescents” (CATMH) regarding use of Internet-based and telephone-based VC. The guidelines focus on interactive VC with the goal of providing the same level of service delivery that is provided in person. CATMH programs involving clinical evaluation and treatments have been successfully implemented in multiple diverse settings such as pediatric clinics (Myers, Sulzbacher, & Melzer, 2004), community mental health centers, rural schools, urban daycare, corrections (Myers, Valentine, & Melzer, 2008), and independent practice (Grady et al., 2011). CATMH has been applied to diverse populations such as African American, Hispanic, Hawaiian, Native American, and Alaska Native youth (Myers et al., 2017).The professional and research literature documents the ability of mental health professional to use VC to successfully fulfill professional roles and complete professional tasks. “Child and adolescent telemental health has been practiced successfully across underserved settings with diverse youth, for most psychiatric disorders, and across development” (Nelson et al., 2017, p. 77). Development of a therapeutic alliance is a robust predictor of positive outcome in mental health treatment and is particularly important when working with children and adolescents.The single most effective means of establishing an alliance with young people is conversation (Gloff et al., 2015). Experienced teleclinicians and preliminary research suggest that clinicians and patients can, and do, establish a therapeutic alliance during telemental health treatments (Goldstein & Glueck, 2016). Satisfaction studies demonstrate the ability to develop a therapeutic alliance with youth and families through telemental health (ATA, 2018). Only occasionally do children and adolescent patients rate alliance, or rapport, as significantly lower for telemental health versus the in-person modality.The feasibility of delivering psychotherapy through VC has been demonstrated for agoraphobia, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, bulimia nervosa, depression, obsessive–compulsive disorder, panic disorder, and posttraumatic stress disorder (Nelson et al., 2017). It also has been shown to be effective in working with children with autism and other developmental disorders (Szeftel, Federico, Hakak, Szeftel, & Jacobson, 2012).VC Use in Forensic Interviews of Children Regarding Possible Child AbuseIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, child protective service agencies across the country have turned to what are being called “tele-forensic interviews” in cases of possible child abuse and neglect. These interviews utilize synchronous VC while interviewing young children in cases involving suspected child abuse, sexual abuse, or neglect. In March 2020, a team from the National Children’s Alliance, Montclair State University, and Central Michigan University developed an extensive protocol for “Emergency Tele-Forensic Guidelines.” These guidelines include detailed instructions for choosing to do the interview as well as how to conduct it (National Children’s Alliance, 2020). In their training webinar, one presenter reported on a yet-to-be published research project comparing interviews conducted by VC with interviews conducted in person. The research involved interviews of 230 children who were 4 to 8 years old using a staged event (e.g., a touching by a male assistant), after which the children were provided misinformation about the event by their parents before being interviewed either face-to-face or by videoconferencing. Preliminary results indicate there were no differences between the accuracy of reports gathered by VC as compared to in-person interviews. There were no differences between true and false reports and no differences with source monitoring problems. While there were age differences showing that younger children were less talkative, there were no indications that children were more suggestible in the VC interviews (National Children’s Alliance, 2020).A separate experimental research project studied the memory reports of 100 children between the ages of 5 and 12 and found that “video-feed interviewing was just as effective as face-to-face interviewing in terms of the accuracy and informativeness of children’s accounts” (Hamilton, Whiting, Brubacher, & Powell, 2016, p. 260). The children were interviewed by experienced interviewers 1 to 2 days after they participated in an innocuous event.VC in Parent–Child Therapy, Parent–Child Observations, and Family TherapyThe central purpose of conducting observations of parent–child interactions is to provide an important source of information for assessing parent–child connections and dynamics, to focus on each parent’s ability to respond to the needs of the child, observe a child’s response to each parent, and to consider potential risks and concerns within the parent–child relationship or contextual factors that may impede or facilitate these relationships. (Saini & Polak, 2014, pp. 185–186)Many are concerned that use of VC for parent–child observations may not be feasible or might yield less helpful or less reliable information than in-person observations. This is already a concern about in-person CCEs. The available research on observations during evaluations shows considerable variability between evaluators, which suggests that evaluators may not be systematically studying the same dimensions of parenting (Saini & Polak, 2014). Whether or not a parent–child observation is valid and reliable depends upon how the task is introduced, how the task is interpreted by the parent and child (or children), and what happens when performing the task.If properly used, it is possible that synchronous VC technology could enhance the ecological validity of the parent–child observations (Comer, Furr, Kerns, et al., 2017). Several studies have found VC as effective as in-person service delivery in addressing parent–child interactions. For example, remotely conducted parent–child interaction therapy (PCIT) has been shown to be feasible and to have comparable outcomes to clinic-based treatments with several small subgroups of children with anxiety-related conditions (such as obsessive–compulsive disorder; Comer, Furr, Kerns, et al., 2017) and externalizing youth (Comer, Furr, Miguel, et al., 2017).In-office PCIT uses real-time, in-session parent coaching where the therapist monitors family interactions from an observation room and provides live, individualized coaching via a parent-worn bug-in-the-ear device (Crum & Comer, 2016, p. 230). Internet PCIT simply changes the location of the therapist from behind a screen in another room to feedback from a remote location through a Bluetooth earpiece. In addition, behavioral parent training for parents and their children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder found similar effectiveness rates among those who received the services online versus those who received services face to face (Dupaul et al., 2017). Obviously, there is a need to adequately capture the parent–child interaction via VC in order for this process to work.In addition, the use of videos for a broad spectrum of consultation, research, and therapy purposes has been well documented. For example, video observations have been central to research on attachment and early parent–infant relationships (Gridley, Bywater, & Hutchings, 2018; Rusconi-Serpa, Sancho Rossignol, & McDonough, 2009; Steele et al., 2014).Logistical problems increase as the number of people in the VC increases. There is no data on family therapy by VC. Critical issues specific to family-based telemental health care include (a) navigating varying levels of technological literacy across generations of participants, (b) deciding which family members to include, (c) ensuring the safety of participant, (d) optimizing therapeutic alliance and engagement of all participants, (e) navigating logistical concerns in conducting sessions, and (f) ensuring privacy (Crum & Comer, 2016). These developments demonstrate that such technological innovations can be used to overcome many traditional barriers to effective care (Comer et al., 2015), but no research on these issues is currently available.The Ethics of Using VC in RCCEsThe practice of telemental health, including VC, involves consideration of ethical standards, legal requirements, telecommunication technologies, and individual practitioner policies and procedures that must be balanced with any other external constraints or demands of the particular professional context (APA, 2013a). The same ethical standards for delivering in-person services apply to professionals providing services using VC. It is the professional’s responsibility to maintain and enhance their level of understanding of their professional ethics, the concepts specific to VC service delivery (APA, 2013a), and to integrate any unique demands using VC might have on their work into their policies, practices, and procedures.The goal of most telemental health services is to approximate the same best practices of in-person service delivery (APA, 2013a). Generally, the same liabilities, risks, and ethical issues encountered during in-person practice apply to telemental health. The APA Telepsychology Task Force provides eight telepsychology-specific guidelines for practitioners (see Table 1;TABLES AND FIGUREStable/figure thumbnailTable 1. Eight Guidelines for Practice of Telepsychology (APA, 2013a)View larger image > in this page > in new window> Download slideAPA, 2013a). These guidelines address issues of competence, standards of care in the delivery of telepsychology services, informed consent, confidentiality of data and information, security and transmission of data and information, disposal of data and information and technologies, testing and assessment, and interjurisdictional practice.However, the geographical distance between the provider and service recipient and the use of technology as the medium of service provision introduce additional risks and considerations that extend beyond those of conventional in-person services (Luxton et al., 2016). In its guidelines for informed consent when using video-based technology, the ATA identified several situation-specific conditions that must be addressed as part of ethical telemental health practice (see Table 2;TABLES AND FIGUREStable/figure thumbnailTable 2. American Telemedicine Association Guidelines for Informed Consent and Preparation for SessionsView larger image > in this page > in new window> Download slideTurvey et al., 2013, p. 11).Evaluators using VC to conduct RCCEs must meet the ethical standards of their respective disciplines and apply these ethical standards to the virtual task. Evaluators using VC must establish appropriate verification, confidentiality, and security parameters consistent with the CCE and the privacy interests of the parties (Shore et al., 2018). This includes taking care to verify the identity of those being interviewed or observed, using procedures to protect the privacy of those being interviewed, and using technology with adequate security protections. Evaluators also must provide use technologies that provide quality audio and video images for the interviews or observations.Another ethical issue reflects allegiance to the principles of evidence-based or evidence-informed practice. In the context of CCEs, evaluators expect that, when providing opinions and testimony based on novel or emerging principles or methods, they make known the status and limitations of these principles and methods (APA, 2013a, p. 9). Standard 9.02 (“Use of Assessments”) of the Ethics Code is particularly relevant when considering an alternative method of assessment, be this an alternative interviewing technique or test administration:Psychologists administer, adapt, score, interpret, or use assessment techniques, interviews, tests, or instruments in a manner and for purposes that are appropriate in light of the research on or evidence of the usefulness and proper application of the techniques.Psychologists use assessment instruments whose validity and reliability have been established for use with members of the population tested. When such validity or reliability has not been established, psychologists describe the strengths and limitations of test results and interpretation. (APA, 2017)Best Practice Guidelines for VCEvaluators who use VC must competently and reasonably adapt the best practice guidelines that have been developed for VC and other telemental health service deliveries to the CCE context. Like the detailed provisions of the conceptual model outlined earlier, best practice guidelines emphasize consistent practices and are designed to reduce practitioner errors. It is important to assume competent use of VC in considering its use. Many opposed to using VC cite fears and problems that are often easily remedied with adequate planning and forethought. For example, some have noted concerns about the identity of the person being interviewed or that another person might be present in the room coaching the interviewee, either adult or child, about how to answer certain questions. These concerns can be dispelled by scanning the room prior to or even during interviews. The value of use of VC should be judged on the “steel man argument” (what is likely when competent practices are followed) rather than a “straw man argument” (where those using VC are characterized as making silly mistakes that reflect incompetence in the evaluator rather than problems in the technique).The acceptance of use of VC technology in clinical practice, as shown by numerous professional theory and evidence-informed best practice guidelines, is undeniable. For psychiatrists, the American Psychiatric Association has recognized VC as a legitimate service delivery mechanism since 1998 and, in 2018, together with the ATA, promulgated a statement, “Best Practices in Videoconferencing-Based Telemental Health” (Shore et al., 2018). The American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2008) introduced its guidelines, “Practice Parameter for Telepsychiatry With Children and Adolescents,” in 2008. For psychologists, the APA issued “Guidelines for the Practice of Telepsychology” in 2013. The APA guidelines were presented as informed by professional theories, evidence-based practices, and definitions in an effort to offer the best guidance in the practice of telepsychology (APA, 2013a). For social workers, a group of professional organizations (National Association of Social Workers, Association of Social Work Boards, Council on Social Work Education, & Clinical Social Work Association, 2017) created the “Standards for Technology in Social Work Practice” in 2017.In addition, telepractitioners are developing their own professional identity and have promulgated additional evidence-based best practice guidelines. The ATA, an interdisciplinary professional group, has published multiple practice guidelines. These include (a) “Evidence-Based Practice for Telemental Health” in 2009 (published in 2011), (b) “Practice Guidelines for Videoconferencing-Based Telemental Health” in 2009, (c) “Practice Guidelines for Video-Based Online Mental Health Service” in 2013 (Turvey et al., 2013), (d) “A Lexicon of Assessment and Outcome Measures for Telemental Health” in 2013 (Shore et al., 2014), and (e) “Practice Guidelines for Telemental Health with Children and Adolescents” in 2017 (Myers et al., 2017).Deviations from the guidelines may be acceptable, but departures from customary protocols must be justified.If circumstances warrant, a practitioner may responsibly pursue a course of action different from the guidelines when, in the reasonable judgment of the practitioner, such action is indicated by the condition of the patient, restrictions or limits on available resources, or advances in information or technology subsequent to publication of the guidelines. Nonetheless, a practitioner who uses an approach that is significantly different from these guidelines is strongly advised to provide documentation, in the patient record, that is adequate to explain the approach pursued. (Turvey et al., 2013, p. 5)Practical Considerations Regarding Using VC in Assessments and TherapyParties agreeing to an RCCE must be functionally capable of using the technology. While no studies have specifically identified any patient subgroup that does not benefit from, or is harmed by, mental health care provided through remote VC (Turvey et al., 2013), professionals using VC must determine that interviewees are intellectually, emotionally, physically, linguistically, and functionally capable of using the technology (Luxton et al., 2016). “Other key telepractice elements include assessment of the impact of culture on the client/patient’s (a) overall comfort/socialization with the behavioral health system; (b) comfort and familiarity with the technology; (c) communication, rapport, and trust; and (d) perceptions of confidentiality” (Luxton et al., 2016, paragraph 1758).“Working via technology, then, also requires an understanding of how technology alters a professional clinical relationship and how to compensate for such alterations” (Luxton et al., 2016, paragraph 149). Establishing rapport and an alliance in the provider-interviewee relationship is as important in interactive VC as it is in in-person contact. Rapport allows for the interviewee to be more forthcoming with past and current history and cognitive and emotional experiences. While using VC, interviewers may need to flexibly and creatively adjust how they can communicate things such as understanding or empathy (Grady et al., 2011, p. 136). Verbal communications may be more deliberate to adjust for any auditory lags related to technology use and to clearly indicate when the teleprovider has finished speaking in order to facilitate reciprocity in communication (Nelson et al., 2017, p. 77).Possible LimitationsThere are limitations to use of VC, both in general and within RCCEs. “The lack of physical presence may limit the range of information available or how it can be observed” (Luxton et al., 2014, p. 28). Nonverbal information is useful for determining the patient’s emotional state and, in some cases, risk behaviors. For example, olfactory sensory information can provide clinically relevant information regarding hygiene as well as the use of alcohol or other substances. The observation of psychomotor and other medical symptoms is also important to observe during psychological assessments. VC assessments may be influenced by camera angle, screen size, room characteristics, or other technical factors that prohibit the observation of all behaviors. The lack of physical presence, however, may limit the range of information available, how it can be observed, or how the patient presents (Luxton et al., 2014). This is not, however, an insurmountable obstacle.Home-based telemental health services may not be appropriate if there is a serious concern for patient safety (Gloff et al., 2015). “Certain high-risk families, such as families with maltreatment histories, may be inappropriate for remote telemental healthcare” (Comer & Myers, 2016, p. 299). Patients with a history of adverse reactions to treatment (e.g., severe panic attacks) or those who are at high risk of harm to self or others (e.g., family members in the case of home-based telemental health) may not be appropriate for telemental assessment (Luxton, O’Brien, McCann, & Mishkind, 2012).Providers are expected to consider geographic location, technological competence (both psychologist and client/patient), medical conditions, mental status and stability, psychiatric diagnosis, current or historic use of substances, treatment history, and therapeutic needs that may be relevant to assessing the appropriateness of the services offered. Prior to engaging in remote assessments, it is wise to review the patient’s clinical history to determine potential clinical, cognitive, and/or sensory deficits that could impair their ability to use telehealth technology (APA, 2013a). While telemental health developed out of a need in underserved rural population areas, patients in densely populated areas also have benefitted from decreased travel times caused by high traffic volumes that make traveling even short distances a problem.Defending VC in RCCEs in Court: The Evidentiary ArgumentEvaluators choosing to use VC in RCCEs may face challenges in court about whether their methods meet the legal standards for admissibility of expert testimony found in the Daubert trilogy and/or the Frye case for admissibility of expert testimony (Flynn, 2019). To successfully defend their work product, evaluators must demonstrate that they qualify as an expert with competencies in CCEs and the technology that was used and that they have properly and reliably collected sufficient relevant data and facts to support their inferences, conclusions, and opinions.The position espoused here is that the uniqueness of a child custody evaluation is found in the conceptual model for the evaluation that informs the collection of data and facts and in the manner in which the analysis of the data and facts is conducted, not in the data collection methods themselves. That is, both clinical and forensic evaluations involve gathering information from documents, interviews, observations, and testing in order to address the presenting problem(s) or situation. These contextual considerations are, of course, very important, but RCCEs should be independently considered based on their scientific and empirical merit rather than on general acceptance among like-minded members of some guild (Faigman, 2013, pp. 908–909). In each instance, there are requirements to establish rapport, elicit cooperation with the data collection task, and objectively collect data and facts about the presenting problem(s) and situation. In both clinical and forensic settings, evaluators are expected to apply the same intellectual rigor to the tasks (Kumho v. Carmichael, 1999). Accuracy and objectivity are always important, whether informing treatment of a patient or helping the court in a legal dispute. By following these principles, evaluators performing RCCEs can produce valid and reliable reports that will help courts in their efforts to revolve custody disputes.ConclusionThe COVID-19 pandemic has at least temporarily and perhaps permanently changed the landscape of mental health service delivery, including the conduct of child custody evaluations. Currently and into the foreseeable future, some CCEs must be remotely done via VC to ensure the safety of the parties and the evaluators. The learning curve for using these technologies in this context is a steep one. There is a lot to learn and a need to learn and apply it quickly. VC can become the lens through which data and facts are collected (J. W. Gould, personal communication, June 20, 2020). Evaluators must use technologies that provide high-quality audio and video images for the interviews and observations. Evaluators need to be prepared to provide information regarding the technology they used, why they chose that technology, and how that technology worked during the data collection interviews or observations. They must establish that they used appropriate verification, confidentiality, and security parameters consistent with the CCE and the privacy interests of the parties (Shore et al., 2018).Family courts that were overwhelmed prior to the pandemic are likely to be even more overwhelmed when they reopen. There likely will be many changes, but the need for the help of experts, including custody evaluators, is likely to remain a priority. For evaluators who conduct RCCEs, the new competence requirements will encompass both CCE and telemental health methods. In these evaluations, evaluators must think through, individualize, and adapt methodologies to help the court answer the questions that were the foci of the dispute.This article articulated a conceptual model illustrating a dynamic, flexible process-oriented approach to creating and defining the scope of the evaluation and collecting data and facts from multiple sources, as well as a process that combines scientific and investigative principles for analyzing this information via comparisons with hypotheses and theories about the case. Regardless of whether a CCE is conducted in person or remotely via VC, evaluators must be able to describe and explain their choices of how they investigated the relevant factors and the psycholegal questions that were the foci of the evaluation and the ways analysis connects the data and facts to their conclusions and recommendations.This article details the growth of the telemedicine and telemental health communities over the past 10 to 15 years from an alternative to reach underserved populations to an alternative within the mainstream mental health professions. This growth is mainly a story of successful applications across people of different ages, different clinical and forensic populations, and different clinical and forensic tasks. In the absence of a vaccine for COVID-19, it is difficult to think of safe mental health service delivery without accommodations. Properly conducted RCCE may be a necessary safe substitute for in-person processes. There are limitations and situations where VC may not be a safe alternative, but the child custody community—for example, courts, attorneys, evaluators, and families—should accept RCCEs as a valid alternative that, when properly done, can help resolve custody disputes. In November 2019, COVID-19—the infectious, highly communicable, and potentially fatal disease caused by a novel coronavirus—originated in Wuhan, China. Within months, its devastating impact had spread worldwide. By April 2020, the United States had the highest number of confirmed COVID-19 cases and COVID-19-related deaths in the world (World Health Organization, 2020). Faced with its most significant public health emergency in modern history, virtually all aspects of U.S. health care were impacted. The American Psychological Association (APA) was quick to provide guidance to mental health practitioners, researchers, and policymakers who faced unprecedented hurdles for conducting their work. Almost immediately, e-mental health (also referred to as telepsychology) was the logistical solution put into practice (Liu et al., 2020; Perrin et al., 2020).E-mental health is the procurement, storage, sharing, and provision of mental health information and services via electronic communication including online databases, telephone, videoconferencing (live, two-way interactions), email, interactive websites, software applications (i.e., apps), and social media. It can be conducted synchronously (in-the-moment) or asynchronously (training modules, email, etc.) and stand-alone or supplement traditional mental health care protocol. It can take place in emergency rooms, outpatient clinics, independent practice—virtually any mental health setting acting as a “hub” for services. Dating back to 1959, e-mental health is associated with improved accessibility, flexibility, reduced costs, times savings, decreased self-stigma, and consumer engagement (Cowan et al., 2019; Lal & Adair, 2014; Luxton et al., 2016). From 2010 to 2017, the United States increased psychiatric e-mental health (i.e., mental health services, such as medication prescribing and management, provided by medical professionals) in state-run facilities from 15% to 29% (Spivak et al., 2020). Several subspecialties of psychology—most notably, counseling psychology—have built evidence bases for its practice (Jacobsen & Kohout, 2010; Luxton et al., 2011). Heilbrun and Brooks (2010) set assessing development and impact of new technologies as part of a proposed agenda for forensic psychology over 10 years ago, but a decade later, forensic psychology’s technology use and exploration lags behind its counterparts.Regarding COVID-19, jails and prisons became “hot spots” for disease transmission (Williams & Ivory, 2020). Correctional settings make for close quarters, and COVID-19 transmission precautions (e.g., limiting one-on-one interactions, social distancing) are nearly impossible for individuals who are incarcerated. Recognizing the high risk for COVID-19 infection, some correctional institutions put into place protective policies such as prohibiting face-to-face visitation (Federal Bureau of Prisons, 2020), including those for forensic mental health practitioners. This severely limited the judicial system’s access to individuals who are incarcerated and incarcerated individuals’ access to mental health evaluation and treatment.Technology as applied to court settings is not new. Videoconferencing has long been common between the courts and correctional settings and is a feasible alternative to in-person hearings (Davis et al., 2015). Defendants have reported the same level of satisfaction and collaboration with their attorneys whether they were communicating in-person or over videoconference (McDonald et al., 2016), and mental health experts have testified via videoconference for decades (U.S. v. Gigante, 1999).Psychiatric e-mental health has made significant progress in correctional settings with diverse clientele across the world (Magaletta et al., 1998; Mars et al., 2012; Maruschak et al., 2016; Senanayake et al., 2018; Shore et al., 2008). A systematic review of psychiatric e-mental health videoconferencing services produced 89 studies that cumulatively suggested this service method has reliability and acceptability in forensic settings and the courts, savings in costs and travel, and enhanced safety and security (Sales et al., 2018). As of 2016, 28 state Department of Corrections systems offered psychiatric e-mental health in conjunction with in-person services (Maruschak et al., 2016). According to North Carolina’s prison system, psychiatric e-mental health “has been invaluable in linking providers to incarcerated people housed in remote prisons where it is not feasible to have a provider based on site” (Sheitman & Williams, 2019, p. 356). Accessibility is increasingly important, considering approximately 20% of jail inmates across the United States are housed in rural jails, most of which are difficult to reach and do not have on-site treatment providers (Kang-Brown & Subramanian, 2017).There is sound reasoning for why forensic e-mental health is a good option for the evaluation and intervention of justice-involved individuals. Individuals who are incarcerated have higher levels of mental health needs than the general public (Bureau of Justice Statistics, 2017), and are, arguably, among those who need psychological attention the most. They are frequently diagnosed with co-occurring mental health and substance use disorders, and have higher rates of traumatic brain injury, requiring complex treatment approaches (Beaudette & Stewart, 2016; Bronson & Berzofsky, 2017; Kessler et al., 2003; Prins, 2014; Shiroma et al., 2012; Sung et al., 2010). In vivo and psychiatric e-mental health modalities (such as medication management) are often critical, but frequently insufficient without other forms of mental health intervention such as psychotherapy and coping skills development. Yet the systems put in place to address the needs of justice-involved individuals are often underresourced and marginalized. In many forensic settings, medication management is the extent of mental health treatment available.Although the COVID-19 crisis has been unique, it provided impetus for the field to critically examine forensic mental health practice, research, and policy and their relationships with technology. “Non-clinical” psychology-law colleagues have practice, research, and policy recommendations on technology-focused topics such as body-worn cameras (Lum et al., 2019) and recording interrogations and eyewitness lineups (Fitzgerald et al., 2018; Kassin et al., 2019; Wells et al., 2020). Technology as applied to forensic mental health is a developing area; however, it is still lacking when considering the many mental health needs of justice-involved individuals. What forensic e-mental health research is available? What legal and mental health needs can be sufficiently addressed via forensic e-mental health, and which should be prioritized for research? How can we integrate practice and research into policy, and how can they complement one another? To address these questions, we present evidence and scholarly commentaries on forensic e-mental health evaluation and intervention, which are used to recommend action for research and policy.Review: Components of Forensic E-Mental HealthForensic EvaluationForensic mental health evaluation is a key component of clinical forensic practice and includes clinical interview and assessment of specific legal issues (e.g., criminal competencies, mental state at the time of the offense, violence risk). Technology-related research has examined the assessment process and use of electronic collateral sources. By far, most forensic e-mental health research involves one’s competency to proceed.Competency to ProceedA 2019 survey of 156 forensic mental health evaluators indicated that approximately 28% had conducted a competency to proceed evaluation via videoconference (Batastini et al.), although this percentage is likely much higher in the aftermath of COVID-19. In one of the first studies to examine standardized evaluations of competence to proceed via videoconference (Lexcen et al., 2006), researchers administered the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale-Anchored Version (BPRS-V) and the MacArthur Competence Assessment Tool-Criminal Adjudication (MacCAT-CA) to a sample of 72 inpatient forensic evaluatees. In the first group, measures were administered by a “local” (in-person) evaluator, while a second, remote evaluator observed and scored administrations over videoconference. In the second group, the remote evaluator administered the measures while the local evaluator observed and scored the measures. In the third group, one local evaluator administered the measures, while a second local evaluator observed and scored only. Although the experimental conditions lacked ecological validity, findings demonstrated adequate interrater reliabilities across the evaluator groups, which provided support that remote BPRS-V and MacCAT-CA administration was not a significant departure from local administration, and can potentially serve as a reliable component of evaluating competence to proceed.A randomized controlled trial of competency evaluations using another tool—the Georgia Court Competency Test–Mississippi State Hospital revision (GCCT-MSH)—demonstrated similar results. Manguno-Mire et al. (2007) randomized forensic inpatients to either local or remote videoconference evaluation formats. In the first condition, a primary evaluator administered the GCCT-MSH locally, while a second evaluator scored the measure remotely. In the second condition, the primary evaluator administered the measure remotely, while the second evaluator scored the measure locally. The results were promising, in that GCCT-MHS scores across conditions had impressive (r ∼ .92) interrater reliabilities. These findings along with Lexcen et al. (2006) are encouraging, but should not be interpreted as full and certain support for remote competency evaluations. Specifically, it should be noted that Lexcen et al. (2006) and Manguno-Mire et al. (2007) had limited sample sizes. Further, these studies examined only one psychometric property: interrater reliability of scores from specific competency measures. Standardized assessment performance reflects only one data point an evaluator may consider when rendering an opinion of a defendant’s competency. To date, it remains unclear if the validity of evaluators’ competency determinations would vary as a function of the evaluation format.Technology as Collateral InformationCollateral sources are requisite for conducting an informed and thorough forensic evaluation (Heilbrun et al., 2014). Consistent with the broad definition of e-mental health, “Googling” clients may be one technological avenue of procuring collateral information related to mental health symptoms and status. Although this practice is generally viewed as a breach of privacy that is unacceptable in typical clinical contexts, the rules shift in forensic evaluation, when collateral information is key to prudent practice. Further, additional electronic collateral information, such as recorded Miranda waivers, surveillance and bodycam video, email, Internet searches, and social media posts, is more readily available for evaluators’ considerations as technology has proliferated.Although forensic mental health scholars have begun to discuss the risks and benefits of Internet-derived data (see Batastini & Vitacco, 2020), there has been little empirical investigation into the matter. In a survey of 102 forensic evaluators, 63.7% reported using social media as collateral information, most often in mental state and child custody evaluations (Coffey et al., 2018). In general, evaluators reported that social media information was not as helpful in developing their forensic opinion as were hospital and police records, clinical interview, surveillance tapes, support staff, and family members. Nevertheless, evaluators did indicate that social media could be helpful in corroborating mental illness, assessing mental state, and determining functional abilities. Interestingly, some evaluators reported using social media (e.g., blogs and podcasts) as data specifically for scoring risk assessment tools. Primary apprehensions over social media use in forensic evaluations included concerns about authenticity, reliability, privacy, consent, and relevance. This small pool of evaluators does not represent the field at large, and evaluators should consider Internet-based data as a form of collateral information to be sought on an individual case basis (Pirelli et al., 2016). Prudent evaluators will consult ethical codes, specialty guidelines, and clinical manuals specific to forensic psychology for determining appropriate use before seeking Internet-based data (Batastini & Vitacco, 2020; Pirelli et al., 2017).Forensic InterventionIn a 2012 practitioner survey, psychotherapists projected that technology would play a key role in psychotherapy by the year 2020 (Norcross et al., 2013). Indeed, technological capabilities have quickly advanced how practitioners conduct mental health intervention since Smith and Glass’s (1977) landmark meta-analysis demonstrating psychotherapy’s effectiveness. In fact, enough literature has been produced that e-mental health interventions have also been meta-analyzed, demonstrating that psychotherapy conducted by telephone or videoconference produce results similar to in-person therapeutic exchanges and is feasible for practice (Backhaus et al., 2012; Jenkins-Guarnieri et al., 2015). With the advent of smart phones, self-management mobile apps have gained in popularity in general, but also in treatment technology (Linardon et al., 2019). Smartphone apps can track moods and physiological functioning, facilitate skills acquisition, serve as virtual coaches, time-stamp mental health-related “assignments,” come preprogrammed with psychoeducation resources and crisis contact information, act as reminders for therapy or other appointments, and provide GPS navigation and monitoring (Luxton et al., 2011).While general psychotherapy e-mental health has proliferated, forensic e-mental health treatment and intervention has inched behind. This is a missed opportunity. Up to 26% of jail inmates and 14% of prisoners report “serious psychological distress” (Bronson & Berzofsky, 2017), yet jails and prisons often lack mental health professionals who are trained in psychotherapy. Encouragingly, the small body of forensic e-mental health intervention research available appears promising.A meta-analysis (Batastini et al., 2016) identified only three empirical between-subjects studies published between 2000 and 2014 specific to e-mental health in correctional settings, and only one (Morgan et al., 2008) focused on psychotherapy intervention. The all-male study, which took place across a general medical center (“hub”) and correctional facility (“remote” site), did not utilize random assignment to treatment conditions (video conference or face-to-face), although the authors noted no marked differences in diagnoses across groups. They found no significant differences in incarcerated individuals’ ratings of working alliance, service engagement, or service satisfaction across conditions. Although this study is an important first step in understanding treatment process, it did not evaluate key outcome variables such as symptom reduction.Several studies have been published since Batastini et al.’s (2016) meta-analysis, and there are many more pilot and feasibility studies that did not utilize comparison groups or “traditional” correctional samples (see Kip et al., 2018). They have concerned specific treatment populations, such as those in administrative segregation, or specific treatment targets, such as substance use and anger management. We now review these niche interventions.Administrative SegregationFollowing Batastini and colleagues’ (2016) meta-analysis, Batastini and Morgan (2016) compared prison inmates in administrative segregation across an in-person CBT coping skills group (n = 12, limited to two participants per group given administrative issues), a coping skills group conducted via teleconference (n = 24, limited to six participants per group), and a no-treatment control group (n = 13). Participants were primarily diagnosed with substance use (38.5%) or mood-related disorder (26.5%) and had an average of 1.3 years in segregated housing. Given the research context, participation was voluntary and random assignment was not methodologically feasible. However, the authors did not identify significant differences in age, ethnicity, offense type, or diagnostic considerations across groups. Findings showed no significant group differences across symptom severity, criminogenic thinking, client satisfaction, working alliance, and perceptions of the treatment group. This study is quite promising for hard-to-reach, administratively segregated individuals, who report more anxiety and depression relative to individuals in the general-population (Chadick et al., 2018). However, the sample sizes were small, necessitating additional research to explore the efficacy of tele-interventions with this population.Community TreatmentTechnology in the form of electronic monitoring has been an integral part of community corrections for decades (Nellis, 2016); however, more nuanced, treatment-focused approaches to offender reentry are few and far between. Continuum of care is critical for justice-involved individuals with severe and persistent mental illness, and integrated rehabilitation systems should address their complex needs (Pinals & Fuller, 2020). Justice-involved individuals who are released from correctional facilities and reenter rural communities may continue to have significant needs but decreased accessibility to mental health care relative to their suburban and urban counterparts. Forensic e-mental health interventions are potential solutions for treating complex mental health needs and reaching difficult-to-access individuals, such as those who lack transportation, live in rural areas, or are less mobile due to disability or medical vulnerabilities.One novel program, Sober IPT (i.e., interpersonal psychotherapy for substance use) aimed to reduce substance use upon community reentry by maintaining continuum of care for justice-involved women with major depressive disorder and co-occurring substance use disorders (Johnson et al., 2015). In this study, women who were incarcerated met with an in-person counselor and attended individual and group therapy for eight weeks prior to their release. At reentry, researchers provided the women mobile “sober phones,” which were preprogrammed to only allow calls to sober resources (e.g., their prison counselor, sober friends and family, and Alcoholics Anonymous) and crisis intervention services. Participants then followed up with their counselor via the sober phone for three months to review goals, address substance use triggers, and receive social support. Participants had good treatment contact and reported the sober phone system was helpful. Although there was no control condition in this study and its sample size was small (N = 22), participant feedback allowed the authors to conclude that the continuum of care “pocket case manager” was worthwhile.Substance UseAlthough the evidence bases for forensic-specific e-mental health is quite limited, foundational work on “forensic-adjacent” issues can inform forensic e-mental health practice. Given the high rates of co-occurring mental health and substance use disorders among offender populations, substance use treatment is particularly relevant. E-mental health interventions taking place via Internet modules, text messaging, self-managed applications, and social networking can be effective in reducing alcohol use and its related risk-taking behaviors (O’Rourke et al., 2016). King and colleagues (2009, 2014) used in-person treatment comparison groups to evaluate substance use outcomes of an e-mental health intervention. Treatment adherence, substance use, therapeutic alliance, and client satisfaction were similar across groups, although overall participants reported preferring e-mental health due to its increased accessibility. A meta-analysis of e-mental health interventions for individuals with substance use disorders in remission found, when compared to control groups, approximately 57% of e-mental health interventions had positive effects (Nesvåg & McKay, 2018), and similar effects were found for adults with problem drinking (Riper et al., 2018). In another meta-analysis specific to alcohol use, approximately 88% had positive effects on substance use measures following e-mental health intervention (Fowler et al., 2016). Virtual reality environments have also been used in cue-exposure behavioral therapy to reduce substance use cravings (Hone-Blanchet et al., 2014).AggressionThe Veterans Affairs (VA) system, the largest integrated health system in the United States, has been a pioneer in videoconferencing mental health services and developed at least 20 e-mental health apps (Gould et al., 2019). Among these, several pertain to coping skills development and anger management. A single group, pre- posttest study of the Remote Exercises for Learning Anger and Excitation Management app demonstrated that following the app intervention, veterans showed decreased anger expression and improvements in social functioning (Morland et al., 2016). In a randomized control trial, the 6-month Cognitive Applications for Life Management (CALM) app intervention (goal setting and planning along with attention training) was associated with significantly decreased self-reported anger (25%) relative to the control group (8% reduction) among veterans with traumatic brain injury and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (Elbogen et al., 2019). Further, collateral contacts reported that CALM participants showed significantly less aggressive behaviors compared to controls. The VA also offers the Veterans Affairs Anger & Irritability Management Skills program (Greene et al., 2014) through online access.To summarize, forensic e-mental health interventions are in short supply but growing in number. Thus far, only a few studies have examined an intervention’s impact using between-subjects and/or randomized controlled trials, making this area fertile ground for future research prior to wide adaptation in treatment settings.Research Priorities for Forensic E-Mental HealthA clear implication from this literature review is the sheer lack of empirical research regarding forensic e-mental health. Considering many forensic mental health questions will be similar to general e-health (e.g., symptom reduction and management, social and coping skills development), researchers and practitioners may somewhat generalize that literature’s nominal findings for use with forensic populations. However, forensic and correctional populations are distinct from the general population and the forensic mental health field is frequently tasked with addressing psycho-legal questions which require extensive training and expertise. Thus, it is imperative that researchers do not assume that nonforensic e-mental health research will generalize and, instead, consider the application of technology to this specific subdiscipline. Adding technology to forensic practice without establishing the benefits and understanding the costs could be deleterious. Considering stakeholders’ (criminal justice-involved individuals, treatment providers, corrections professionals, policymakers) needs, cost, and feasibility, we next prioritize key topics that should rise to the top of the forensic e-mental health research agenda.Validity, Reliability, and Feasibility of Forensic E-Mental Health EvaluationsArguably, forensic mental health evaluation is the foundation of forensic mental health practice: Evaluation findings are often prominent as an individual proceeds through the criminal justice system and influence how supervisory figures and treatment providers determine which interventions, and to which degrees, are suitable. Thus far, the majority of forensic e-mental health evaluation research has focused on the topic of competence to proceed. This is not surprising, given that upward of 60,000 are conducted each year and the “competency crisis” is a pressing issue (Gowensmith, 2019b; Poythress et al., 2002). But there are additional forensic mental health evaluation domains that warrant research investigation. For example, in the Batastini et al. (2019) survey of forensic mental health evaluators, respondents who had experience with videoconference evaluations endorsed conducting violence risk assessment most frequently, followed by competency to proceed, mental state, child custody, and disability evaluations. Assessments of violence risk and mental state can be much more tedious than in-the-moment competency evaluations, given that they typically require lengthier interviews and, when called for, larger assessment batteries. For mental state evaluations in particular, evaluators may inquire about minute details that could be frustrating to seek and answer in the context of video conferencing. Put simply, they most often will require more time and effort than evaluations of competency and may not be the most appropriate for videoconference. Given that practitioners are conducting these evaluations, psycho-legal referral questions aside from competency to proceed are important research avenues to follow.Although we can extrapolate many of the more general videoconferencing literature to forensic contexts, researchers should further examine remote administration of forensic assessment and forensic-relevant instruments, as have researchers studying neuropsychological test administration via videoconference (Brearly et al., 2017). Forensic researchers should focus on the most commonly conducted measures as identified by practitioners, such as the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI), Personality Assessment Inventory, Historical Clinical Risk Management-20 (Douglas et al., 2013), and standardized adjudicative competence measures (Archer et al., 2006; Neal & Grisso, 2014). Several of these measures, such as the MMPI and PAI, are already available via online platforms. They can be administered remotely and securely via screen-sharing technology. Stimuli presentation can be standardized on screen to a significant degree (albeit an examinee’s setting can potentially interfere with administration). But clinician-administered tests, including many critical response style measures (e.g., Miller Forensic Assessment of Symptoms Test, Structured Interview of Reported Symptoms, Test of Memory Malingering), allow more room for error given individual differences in administration. Arguably, response style measures have a greater applied range compared to referral-specific (e.g., competency, violence risk) measures and should be situated high on the research agenda, given that assessment of response style is imperative across all forensic evaluation contexts (Rogers & Bender, 2020).Another important area to explore is whether video recording of an evaluation impacts response style. There are benefits and risks to this practice. On one hand, video creates a more complete examination record, can help resolve later confusions or disputes, and refresh forensic evaluators’ memories when drawing clinical opinions and preparing for trial (Siegel et al., 2018; Zonana et al., 1999). On the other, the process of video recording may impact evaluation dynamics and performance (Otto & Krauss, 2009). Nevertheless, some policymakers have moved forward with certain video recording requirements (e.g., Colorado Code of Criminal Procedure, 2017). A survey of evaluators practicing in Colorado indicated that they generally opposed recording evaluations due to technical challenges, confidentiality concerns, potential misuse, and invalidation of the evaluation (Potts et al., 2018). Before coming to conclusions on this issue, researchers should understand whether video recording produces differing results.An additional area ripe for research concerns the application of forensic e-mental health with linguistically and culturally diverse populations. Over the last several decades global migration has increased such that the U.S. Census Bureau postulated that immigration will fuel population level demographic changes in the United States (Vespa et al., 2020). Reflecting these immigration trends, approximately 21% of the entire U.S. population speak a language other than English in the home (U.S. Census Bureau, 2020). It is reasonable then, that interpreters are commonly used in forensic practice (Weiss & Rosenfeld, 2012). Despite this, very little research has addressed the impact of language interpretation in forensic evaluation, and these samples were drawn from populations with relatively diverse demographics (Kois et al., 2013; Paradis et al., 2016; Varela et al., 2011) Researchers can consider the impact of in vivo versus remote interpretation services, as well as baseline accuracy rates for language interpretation. This work is particularly important to ensure reliable and valid exchange of information and ultimately inform best practice as the population continues to diversify.Somewhat relatedly, researchers should consider the feasibility of forensic e-mental health evaluations with diverse populations. For example, older adults are less likely to report comfort with digital devices and adults living with a physical impairment are less likely to use the Internet than those without such impairment (Gitlow, 2014; Zickuhr & Smith, 2013). Further, across the United States there are severe disparities in Internet accessibility, with lower income and rural populations less likely to have consistent access (Pew Research Center, 2019; U.S. Census Bureau, 2018). Researchers should consider if accommodations are appropriate for individuals participating in forensic e-mental health evaluations who experience discomfort with technology and/or the Internet due to unfamiliarity. If any accommodations are implemented, it is imperative to understand how they affect the validity of the evaluation.Technology-Facilitated InterventionsCompetence RestorationFor the last decade, high rates of competency referrals, forensic mental health staff shortages, and various administrative issues have contributed to the length of time defendants await competency evaluation and/or restoration (Gowensmith, 2019b). There is a dearth of research on restoration in general (Heilbrun et al., 2019), but restoration facilitated by technology could be an efficient practice by broadcasting restoration instructors to difficult-to-reach defendants (e.g., in rural jails or in the community) or those in understaffed facilities. Another benefit of conducting restoration via asynchronous e-means could ensure that defendants new to competence restoration receive psycho-legal instruction in a scaffolded and organized manner, rather than joining a group on a revolving basis. E-administration of competence restoration protocol could also be beneficial for defendants who have special cognitive or language needs (Casas & Leany, 2017). Given that a videoconference approach could reach diverse defendants, it lends itself to outcomes that are more generalizable and research using video modules could enhance fidelity for standardized competency restoration protocols.Cognitive remediation could be an effective tool for individuals undergoing competence to proceed restoration, who are most often diagnosed with psychotic disorders (Pirelli & Zapf, 2020). There are nuanced neurocognitive components to the competency to proceed criteria outlined in the seminal Dusky v. United States (1960) decision: specifically, attention, working memory, and executive functioning. Research indicates that cognitive remediation, typically conducted via computer programs, can improve these functions among individuals with severe and persistent mental illness (Chan et al., 2015; Medalia et al., 2001; Medalia & Richardson, 2005; Medalia & Saperstein, 2013). It follows that cognitive remediation could also improve neurocognitive functioning among defendants opined incompetent to proceed. This assertion is supported by forensic mental health and neuropsychology theory (Schwalbe & Medalia, 2007; Zapf, 2013), as well as a small pilot study that revealed cognitive remediation can improve Dusky reasoning abilities, particularly among individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia (Wilson, 2015).Community TreatmentAs observed by Leifman and Coffey (2015) “. . . one look at ‘treatment as usual’ in many communities would suggest that our typical practice of mental health interventions in criminal justice settings has remained stagnant for decade.” (p. 201). Community interventions in particular fit directly into an exciting “space” for forensic e-mental health research to flourish. Technology, which can be programmed to vary the level of supervision and intervention intensity and frequency, is an opportunity to match an offender’s specific needs to their appropriate level of supervisory and clinical contact. A recent National Institute of Justice collaboration between the RAND Corporation and the University of Denver focused specifically on how stakeholders can use technology to improve community supervision (Russo et al., 2019). Participants identified benefits for individuals under supervision (electronic “check-ins,” automated appearance reminders, positive reinforcement for prosocial behavior), as well as benefits for supervisors themselves (automated reminders for appearance dates and workloads, interactive resources that prompt officers about specific issues to address with offenders). They prioritized a research agenda: How best to hold individuals under supervision accountable via technology? Are virtual check-ins effective at reducing failed appearances and other compliance matters? Which populations are most amenable to e-supervision, and how long should e-monitoring occur? Participants noted that mobile data could lend to validation of “homegrown” risk measures, data mining, and machine learning to identify which interventions and timings are most effective. Ideas such as these can serve as beginning points for researchers interested in community intervention.Forensic e-mental health applies not just to offenders reentering the community, but also individuals followed by assisted outpatient treatment, drug and mental health diversion courts, and other treatment-intensive community programs. To maintain treatment gains among general (nonforensic) samples, individuals exiting inpatient or residential substance use treatment should have continued care for an average of 3 to 6 months (Proctor & Herschman, 2014). Interventions and social support administered via mobile application increases accessibility, and ultimately continuum of care. Recognizing this, the Veterans Health Administration began giving video-enabled tablets with data plans to treatment-seeking individuals who faced barriers to care, such as poor health, lack of transportation, or rural setting (Jacobs et al., 2019). In a retrospective comparison study, Jacobs and colleagues found that the tablet program was associated with improved continuum of care: increased psychotherapy sessions, stronger medication adherence, and fewer missed appointments in general. A second study found that veterans were equally divided in preferring treatment via the tablet program, preferring treatment in-person, or having no preference (Slightam et al., 2020). Despite these promising findings, both studies involved veterans and it is unknown if the beneficial effects of technology application generalize to the forensic population receiving treatment while being monitored in the community. If research establishes similarly positive outcomes with a community-dwelling forensic population, subsequent economic and public health benefits could be consequential.An additional research priority concerns treatment attrition. Treatment drop-out among forensic populations is a major concern as drop-out can have direct impact on mental health functioning as well as indirect legal impact for individuals under mandated treatment or supervision. In fact, one meta-analysis of 114 treatment programs found that violent offenders who began but did not complete mental health treatment were 10% to 23% more likely to recidivate (general, violent, or nonviolent) compared to treatment completers (Olver et al., 2011). These findings held regardless of treatment context (institutional or community-based), although community-dwelling individuals who terminated treatment early were most likely to recidivate. The research indicated that psychotic and personality disorder diagnoses, as well as negative treatment attitudes and behaviors, predicted dropout; however, the interventions neither necessarily targeted treatment engagement nor did they involve e-mental health. CBT-informed anger management intervention attrition was also associated with recidivism in a meta-analysis by Henwood et al. (2015). As such, targeting mental illness and motivation through mobile interventions could increase treatment completion, which could indirectly lead to decreased recidivism rates. Specific to offenders with severe and mental illness, research indicates that timely mental health treatment reduces the likelihood of criminal justice involvement (Constantine et al., 2012). Killikelly et al. (2017), in their systematic review of treatment adherence among individuals with psychosis, found that overall, 83% of participants adhered to web-based and app treatment. Although mobile technology may be promising with this treatment group, interventions should go above and beyond treatment linkage and completion, and address criminogenic as well as service needs in order to maximize results (Epperson et al., 2014; Skeem et al., 2014).Regarding specific psychotherapeutic orientations, cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) has garnered a strong track record with respect to treating justice-involved persons (Antonio & Crossett, 2017; Harrison et al., 2020; Higgs et al., 2018; Mpofu et al., 2018; Olver et al., 2020; Yoon et al., 2017). The Drexel Reentry Project (DRP) developed to address the needs of moderate- to high-risk justice-involved persons at community reentry, uses CBT principles in its multistep program (Heilbrun et al., 2017). Of note, DRP (2020) moved to telehealth in the context of COVID. Data collected from the program’s new treatment approach could make exciting contributions to our understanding of forensic e-mental health with justice-involved individuals under supervision.Substance UseSubstance use intervention is an urgent priority, particularly in the context of the opioid epidemic (Gostin et al., 2017). It is regularly associated with decreased recidivism in addition to decreased relapse (Moore et al., 2018). Probationers with co-occurring mental health and substance use disorders are more likely to recidivate compared to probationers with substance use or mental health problems (Balyakina et al., 2014). A meta-analysis of substance use and mental health reentry programs found that access to social support and housing and continuity of caseworker relationships pre- and postrelease were predictors of success (Kendall et al., 2018). Another study found that lack of social support was associated with substance use, specifically overdose, among people released from prison (Binswanger et al., 2012). Potentially, CBT and social support facilitated by mobile apps or other e-means could serve as a protective factor against substance use. Kramer Schmidt et al. (2018), who meta-analyzed literature on psychosocial interventions for alcohol use disorder, found that research assessing frequency, rather than intended or actual treatment duration, was associated with abstinence and lighter drinking. Frequent mobile “check-in” assessments could have a similar effect. Thus far, few substance use interventions have taken a “tech” approach with justice-involved persons.As of yet, no forensic e-mental health intervention has met the rigor of evidence-based evaluation, let alone one for community-dwelling individuals. A. Batastini (personal communication, April 28, 2020) is extending this line of work by developing an e-therapy app for justice-involved persons in the community. The project is in its developmental stages, with a patent application pending.Policy DirectionsAlthough there is relatively little research on forensic e-mental health, it is nevertheless moving forward. COVID-19 caught much of the field by surprise and practitioners, researchers, and policymakers had to make rapid decisions about how their work should proceed. We find that the time has come to consider implementation of forensic e-mental health on a larger scale, and are firm in the belief that it is far better to be proactive, rather than reactive, in advancing research so that we may best adapt our practice. At the same time, we acknowledge the relative dearth of research necessitates caution when implementing policies without careful consideration of the legal and ethical consequences of embracing forensic e-mental health. The following policy considerations are offered.Need for Professional ConsensusWhen the United States began to feel the major effects of COVID-19, psychologists looked to professional organizations, colleagues, test developers, technology experts, and literature on conducting work via e-means. The APA referred its community to its preexisting General Practice Guidelines for Telepsychology (Joint Task Force for the Development of Telepsychology Guidelines for Psychologists, 2013) and provided resources for teaching and research using technology. Subspecialty professional groups have contributed more specific practice recommendations (e.g., the Inter Organizational Practice Committee, comprising members of the American Academy of Clinical Neuropsychology (AACN), Division 40 of the APA, the National Academy of Neuropsychology (NAN), the American Board of Professional Neuropsychology (ABN), and the American Psychological Association Services). The American Psychology-Law Society (AP-LS) and the American Board of Forensic Psychology have not yet produced official positions on the use of technology in psychology-law clinical practice. Encouragingly, AP-LS has developed a telehealth task force (J. Groscup, personal communication, May 8, 2020) to develop and promulgate guidelines for the field. Technology is rapidly changing, more quickly than guidelines can be offered by professional organizations (Vitacco et al., 2018). Future guidelines should be broad to allow for extrapolation to newly developed technologies.Implementing Forensic E-Mental HealthThe great task of implementing a new forensic e-mental health system can appear overwhelming, if not daunting. Transitions can actually take place quite quickly: Yellowlees et al. (2020) described how, within 3 days, the University of California–Davis Health System transitioned to 100% telepsychiatry practice at the beginning of the COVID-19 crisis. Fortunately, numerous colleagues have published guidance on how to build and sustain these infrastructures (Hilty et al., 2015; Hilty et al., 2016; Luxton & Niemi, 2019; Smith et al., 2020). To begin, stakeholders, needs, and target populations must be identified. An “e-health Readiness Assessment” will help stakeholders plan project goals (e.g., is the purpose to conduct intake assessments, psychotherapy, emergency care, and/or research? What technology resources are already in place, and are they sufficient? What are our cultural and linguistic needs? What disparities can we anticipate?). Funding should be secured to adequately cover the costs of providing services (direct and indirect costs including technology, staff, and supporting materials), reimbursement protocol (when relevant) and continuity of care should be coordinated. Cost sharing across agencies or institutions (clinics, hospitals, corrections, the courts) should be preagreed upon, particularly given the fiscal complexities of federal, state, and county budgets. Technology should be specified with encryption networks. All professionals involved should be trained in e-mental health and the system’s supervisory and crisis protocols (e.g., what is the chain of command within and across institutions?). Careful documentation of challenges along the way should be part of a feedback loop used to continually improve infrastructure and practice. A review by Edge et al. (2019) is an especially valuable resource for those interested in implementation barriers to forensic e-mental health. “Case studies” on the many ways forensic e-mental health may be implemented are also available (see Batastini et al., 2020; Farabee et al., 2016; Kaftarian, 2019; Luxton & Lexcen, 2018; Magaletta et al., 2000; Miller et al., 2008).Traditional mental health care models will need to be adapted. Integrated care can be facilitated by tele-teaming, that is, communication among virtual treatment teams via synchronous or asynchronous electronic means (Waugh et al., 2015). Tele-teaming is well-suited for forensic mental health treatment providers, which can involve groups composed of psychologists, psychiatrists, social workers, primary care providers, probation officers or other community supervision professionals, and so on (Cuddeback et al., 2020; Parker et al., 2018). Tele-teaming models include multiperson treatments/therapies, facility-based-settings, where a remote individual of a specific discipline reaches out to a “home base” onsite mental health facility, and primary care models. In their scoping review, Parker et al. (2018) identified 12 team models that addressed forensic mental health, including interdisciplinary teams collaborating on prearrest, postbooking, and jail diversion; co-responding (law enforcement and mental health professionals address acute mental health crises simultaneously), information sharing agreements (e.g., sex offender registries), and reentry programs. Parker and colleagues’ review showed rich opportunity for adopting technology across these many aspects of forensic mental health. In the future, we may see a move away from using technology to mimic in-person care, and increased use of artificial intelligence, robotics, metrics and data mining, mobile apps, and virtual reality (Shore, 2019) in workflow and treatment configurations.As noted by Batastini et al. (2018), joint ventures between academic and community-based collaborators as resources can be helpful in implementing forensic e-mental health. There could be mutual needs across the university and forensic mental health community. Academic centers typically have strong information technology infrastructure and their research missions often involve meeting the needs of local communities; therefore, e-mental health, particularly for underserved populations such as individuals in the forensic realm, could fit nicely into their research agendas (Caudill & Sager, 2015). The University of Washington (UW) has implemented academic-community based partnerships specific to psychiatric e-mental health (Kimmel et al., 2019) and a forensic teaching service (Piel et al., 2019). In fact, following the landmark Trueblood v. State of Washington Department of Human and Social Services (2015), the 2016 Washington State Legislature directed UW, the state’s Department of Social and health Services, and state psychiatric hospital to develop a forensic teaching service with the goal of facilitating forensic psychiatry services in particular. In Texas, the University of Texas Medical Branch and Texas Tech University Health Services provide all psychiatric services via e-mental health for individuals incarcerated by the Texas Department of Criminal Justice (Raimer & Stobo, 2004). University-based forensic clinics simultaneously provide valuable training experience and contribution to the community (Heilbrun et al., 2013). A book on the ways universities can collaborate with criminal justice programming is forthcoming (Heilbrun et al., in press).There are others’ “lessons learned” that should be considered prior to embarking on new forensic e-mental health endeavors. In their reflection on the development of a psychiatry e-mental health program, Ulzen et al. (2013) delineated the successes and challenges of their collaboration between the University of Alabama School of Medicine–Tuscaloosa and a local nonprofit mental health clinic. For example, there may be unanticipated changes in leadership or institutional directions, which both have the potential to derail the e-mental health service agenda. The authors emphasized that enthusiasm and project advocacy was critical. In the earlier period of their collaboration, Alabama law indicated that to bill for services, a physician must be present at the hub and the remote site—which essentially negates the efficiency and cost savings of e-mental health. The group lobbied state legislature, and a new law was passed that allowed for billing if at least one Medicaid-eligible provider is present at the remote site.Training and EducationPsychology-law is a fast-growing area of clinical expertise, which can require training and education in assessment, intervention, and research across a range of settings (DeMatteo et al., 2019). Magaletta et al. (2013) surveyed 170 APA-accredited psychology doctoral programs and found that 111 (65%) offered experience in corrections, and a follow-up study showed that intervention comprised the majority of corrections practicum experience (Magaletta et al., 2017). The number of predoctoral psychology internships with correctional or forensic components have tripled over the last decade (Malesky & Croysdale, 2009; Potts et al., 2020). Forensic e-mental health provides a novel avenue for training and supervising students interested in this career trajectory. For example, trainees and supervisors can remotely coconduct forensic evaluations via three-way videoconference (M. A. Conroy, personal communication, May 15, 2020) and remote live supervision (i.e., the “bug in the ear” method of supervision) has long been an option (Rousmaniere, 2014). Interested readers can refer to McCord et al. (2015), who detailed their training protocol specific to counseling psychology doctoral students at Texas A&M University’s Telehealth Counseling Clinic. Psychiatry colleagues (Saeed et al., 2017) have also provided 12 guidelines for graduate medical education in telepsychiatry, including awareness of the remote location’s resources (e.g., local emergency room and coordinated care colleagues), understanding the laws and ethics related to e-mental health, recognizing when e-mental health practice is appropriate for a particular client, and considering issues of test integrity.Of course, training and education do not conclude with graduation. The University of New Mexico School of Medicine’s Law and Mental Health Lecture Series has offered free, weekly, 1-hr continuing education (CE) credit sessions since 2018 on psychology-law topics via Zoom videoconference and plans to continue this opportunity indefinitely (J. Brovko, personal communication, May 8, 2020). This is a generous online service afforded to the forensic practitioner community and serves as a model that can be replicated by other academic, clinical, and correctional institutions throughout the country. The Standards and Criteria for Approval of Sponsors of Continuing Education for Psychologists (APA, 2015) indicates that there are no fees for offering and granting CE credits; rather, CE “sponsors” must meet criteria outlined therein (see https://www.apa.org/about/policy/approval-standards.pdf). For practitioners in search of in-depth training on forensic topics, ConceptCE at Palo Alto University (https://concept.paloaltou.edu/) offers a host of synchronous and asynchronous continuing education training opportunities, ranging from one to 60-hr CE courses.Make Data Accessible for Researchers and PolicymakersA remarkable benefit of e-mental health is that in many cases, data can be automatically populated into electronic records and exported for statistical analyses. This offers exciting prospects for research across the sequential intercept model, that is, the many points individuals may enter or delve deeper into the criminal justice system and their opportunities for intervention (Munetz & Griffin, 2006). At the individual-evaluator level, several sources recommend evaluators track referral sources, case characteristics, and penultimate psycho-legal opinions in a personal database (Dror & Murrie, 2018; Gowensmith & McCallum, 2019; Guarnera et al., 2017). Gowensmith (2019a) expanded this idea when developing the mobile phone application called Case Rate (www.caserate.org), in which evaluators can input a variety of variables, calculate caseload-wide descriptive statistics, and compare their own case details to colleagues’ through its crowd-sourced data function. The app simplifies database maintenance given its mobile accessibility and is a novel usage of technology for data procurement, storage, and sharing, as well as monitoring potential evaluation biases.While criminal justice has a number of nationwide databases housing policing, correctional, and victimization statistics, there is little available specific to forensic mental health aside from specialty court data. We advocate for the development of forensic-specific electronic databases, developed for quality assurance and improvement rather than for specific research projects. This effort has been in place at the University of Virginia via its long-standing Forensic Evaluation Information System (Murrie et al., 2020; Warren et al., 1991) and more recent Custom Application Consulting Service (CACS; Warren, 2018). CACS consists of case management software specific to juvenile adjudicative competence. The paperless system allows for analysis of real-time service delivery data, calendar alerts for impending court deadlines, a streamlined progress note system, a searchable database for finding case-relevant data, management of billing and program costs, and production of administrative summary reports. Like Case Rate, CACS is moving toward a mobile phone app interface (Kois et al., 2019). More recent efforts include Quality Assurance and Quality Improvement databases such as the Alabama Forensic Assessment and Research Evaluation Project (Alabama FARE, Kois & Cox, 2020) and the patient research database at Massachusetts’ Bridgewater State Hospital (Fairfax-Columbo et al., 2020). These state-level projects are encouraging; however, bringing together national data through organized means will help us better understand epidemiology of mental health and criminogenic factors among forensic populations, as well as how to mitigate these factors.Researchers and policymakers should understand issues around confidentiality and privacy prior to data-sharing, as various entities (e.g., law enforcement, vs. corrections, vs. forensic hospitals) have very different HIPAA obligations (Petrila et al., 2015). Further, prior to practicing any form of e-mental health which includes the collection of client data, governing bodies should clearly outline data sharing and storage requirements. This includes directions for practitioners and researchers regarding efforts to protect against cyber-security attacks. It is promising that many licensing boards and professional organizations (e.g., APA) already offer guidance on data protection within cyberinfrastructure. However, considering technology and its application to the mental health field is constantly evolving, policymakers should remain diligent in updating data security recommendations and requirements.BarriersImplementing forensic e-mental health is easier said than done. The initial and most crucial hurdle is obtaining stakeholder buy-in. Although research consistently shows that e-mental health consumers perceive it as acceptable and feasible, practitioners tend to rate lower overall satisfaction with e-mental health relative to in-person format. A survey of substance use treatment providers found that nearly half were concerned that their staff would not accept the implementation of e-mental health use through mobile apps, phone, text message, instant message, videoconference, or web-based modules, but suspected that only one fifth of clients would not accept these e-interventions (Faragher et al., 2018). In their study of videoconference MacCAT-CA administration, Manguno-Mire et al. (2007) found that practitioners reported technological difficulties (i.e., wifi connectivity, audio/verbal lag, poor feedback, and audiovisual quality) as the most problematic issues. A survey of forensic practitioners noted ethical and legal concerns along with limitations in conducting psychological assessments via videoconference as most problematic (Batastini et al., 2019).If and when the time comes, large scale implementation of forensic e-mental health will require a significant culture shift within the scientific and clinical fields, as well as within institutions (i.e., psychiatric hospitals, correctional facilities, community supervision offices) that are, historically, slow to evolve. Eventual forensic e-mental health implementation will also require the support of state and local legislators who allocate funds for community mental health and correctional services. For institutions and organizations, forensic e-mental health would require significant upfront costs, which will take time to recoup. For example, Rappaport et al. (2018) examined the cost-savings of implementing telehealth (with a focus on primary and emergent care) throughout Maryland’s Department of Corrections and found that it took approximately 32 months for the program to regain its initial investment ($1.2 million). Despite this, there are reports of programs and institutions that have successfully lobbied for this support. For example, the mental health court/jail diversion system between Rikers Island and New York City Diversion Courts conducts virtually all violence risk assessments via videoconference (M. Rotter, personal communication, April 28, 2020). Of note, W. N. Gowensmith and D. Murrie (personal communication, May 9, 2020) reported that colleagues from Colorado’s Office of Behavioral Health secured funds for videoconference technology (including video-enabled mobile phones) for Colorado defendants undergoing inpatient and outpatient restoration in the context of COVID-19.We acknowledge forensic institutions are grossly under resourced and underfunded (Pinals, 2014), and the downward trajectory of funding for public mental health resources is unlikely to rebound given the near global economic devastation associated with COVID-19. We acknowledge financially struggling systems may have difficulty implementing programs requiring substantial upfront costs, particularly without assistance from local, state, and federal governments. Further, the cost-effectiveness of e-mental health programs is variable (Lal & Adair, 2014) and largely depends on the quality and extensiveness of implementation. When considering these financial barriers, institutions should consider whether the result justifies the (costly) means and what e-mental health program will be most efficacious given the priorities of the unit and the population being served.For practitioners working outside of a government funded system, the length of time needed to recoup the initial costs may be infeasible. Perhaps not surprisingly, practitioners have reported reimbursement as a reason for not adopting e-mental health in the past (Faragher et al., 2018). It is possible these practitioners may find value in “teaming up” with other practitioners to share initial costs, as some do when buying materials and renting space for independent practice. Despite the initial financial considerations, within a short period of time, forensic e-mental health can result in quantifiable, organizational-level cost saving, as well as less tangible improvement in public safety (Rappaport et al., 2018).A number of ethical considerations should be noted. It is critical to determine whether e-mental health is appropriate on an individual case basis, that is, according to the practitioner’s skill and the validity and reliability of the technology-assisted technique as applied to a given examinee (APA, 2013, 2017). Practitioners should reference relevant ethical codes to guide this decision-making process. During this unprecedented pandemic, emergency services are acceptable and encouraged; however, moving forward, it is imperative that advancements in practice and policy are proactive, evidence-based, and intentional rather than reactive.A final consideration is the differential access to the technological resources necessary for implementation. Recently highlighted by many school systems’ sudden transition to online education due to COVID-19 (Hall et al., 2020), across the country differential access to reliable Internet and digital devices exacerbates preexisting gaps between socioeconomic classes and largely impacts people of color and rural communities (Pew Research Center, 2019). If the cost of participation in forensic e-mental health is placed largely on the consumer, it is possible financial barriers could subsequently impair treatment performance. Relatedly, forensic e-mental health may not be appropriate for certain populations, such as older adults who may be less tech-savvy. As the field increasingly adopts this approach, it is imperative that policymakers, researchers, and clinicians consider accessibility and affordability (see Luxton et al., 2016).ConclusionThus far, forensic psychology falls steps behind the technological advancements of our medical, psychiatry, and counseling psychology colleagues. Research to date is largely focused on forensic e-mental health evaluation, specifically competency to proceed, and correctional interventions. There is ample opportunity to explore how technology can improve other evaluation and intervention practices. The world of technology is too vast for one article to cover every technological innovation that could be applied to forensic mental health. We did not report every study, nor did we address every area of forensic e-mental health that could benefit from technological means. Rather than a systematic review, this article is a beginning point for forensic mental health practitioners, researchers, and policymakers to gain exposure to which technologies are available, their evidence base, and what they may expect in the future.Necessity is the mother of invention. The COVID-19 pandemic presented unexpected changes to forensic mental health practice, research, and policy; however, it also has allowed for unparalleled advancements in how the forensic mental health field can leverage technology. Given its ease, accessibility, and widespread use during COVID-19, it is likely that forensic e-mental health will persist in many practice, research, and policy contexts once there is a (relative) “return to normal.” It is our hope that the COVID-19-necessaitated technology zeitgeist provides impetus for exciting innovations in the field of forensic psychology. In mid-March, 2020, the authors—as well as the majority of therapists—were advised to work from home rather than the office to help stop the spread of Covid-19. Thus, the Covid-19 pandemic began to shape a new personal and professional reality that specifically related to how therapists provide psychotherapy services. The uncertain duration of this new professional reality has constrained therapists in ways that no one could have predicted and has required significant adjustments to be made and creativity to be employed in terms of finding new ways to work remotely and effectively from home offices that were perhaps never originally intended to serve as therapeutic spaces.In this mixed-method study, we focused on assessing psychotherapists’ challenges providing psychotherapy services from home during the Covid-19 pandemic. We examined the specific adaptations participants implemented to improve their experiences and their clients’ experiences in the therapeutic relationship. This article offers readers an opportunity to learn about ways to overcome challenges while providing teletherapy from home. Finally, it offers participants’ perceptions about the possibility of returning to the office to see clients in person.Literature ReviewThere is ample research on effective remote psychotherapy. The results from some studies have shown that it can be as effective as in-person psychotherapy (Poletti et al., 2020; Roesler, 2017), such as the systematic reviews that have been done on videoconferencing as a psychotherapy tool (Backhaus et al., 2012; Shigekawa et al., 2018; Simpson, 2009). A body of empirical literature related to the delivery of remote psychotherapy from therapists’ homes is gradually developing. Evans et al. (2020) have focused on a new ethical conflict that has arisen in the field since the emergence of the Covid-19 pandemic. They have found that continuing to see clients face-to-face would put the lives of therapists and their patients at risk and would therefore be unethical, but terminating with clients during a global pandemic would not be best practice either. To mediate this conflict, many clinicians have chosen to continue providing treatment by working remotely.Békés and Aafjes-van Doorn (2020) surveyed 145 psychotherapists to collect their demographics and assess their attitudes toward online psychotherapy during the Covid-19 pandemic. The majority of the participants were women who resided in the United States and worked in independent practice. The participants were recruited via professional email lists, social media, and individual contacts. Most of the participants reported a somewhat positive attitude toward the transition to online psychotherapy during the pandemic. The results from this study showed that positive attitudes toward online psychotherapy were correlated with past positive experiences with providing remote services. Attitudes toward online psychotherapy were also influenced by the participants’ reports of feeling tired, less connected, and less authentic in sessions. Another important variable was the modality of treatment that the clinician used. Participants who utilized a cognitive–behavioral approach reported more positive attitudes toward online psychotherapy compared with those who used a primarily psychodynamic approach. The authors of the study speculated that this may have been due to the fact that psychodynamic therapy places a greater emphasis on the relational process as a mechanism of change—more so than other short-term modalities such as cognitive–behavioral therapy. This empirical study has made an important contribution as one of the very first to explore therapists’ attitudes toward their work during the pandemic.MacMullin et al. (2020) used the actor–network method, which is an approach to studying science and technology that focuses on the integration of networks (Latour, 2013), to qualitatively investigate psychotherapists’ experiences with online therapy. They conducted five semistructured interviews with Canadian psychotherapists who worked independent practice and found that the participants were comfortable with remote work and felt it was effective. However, they reported that the participants expressed some confusion about how to set boundaries with clients during the therapeutic interaction when providing online therapy and their ability to trust technology (the platform they used and Internet connection).Békés et al.’s (2020) survey on therapists’ experiences of practicing psychotherapy or psychoanalysis remotely during Covid-19 yielded similar results. The researchers recruited 190 therapists using professional listservs mainly from the fields of psychology, social work, and psychiatry. The majority of the participants were women who worked in independent practice and lived in the United States. The researchers found that the participants felt confident in their work with patients and were able to relate and stay emotionally connected and authentic during their online encounters. While their views on remote therapy were more positive during the pandemic than they were prepandemic, the majority of the participants still found in-person therapy to be more effective.Finally, Aafjes-van Doorn et al. (2020) studied levels of vicarious trauma among 339 therapists as a result of working with traumatized patients during the Covid-19 pandemic. The participants were psychotherapists who had seen at least one client in remote sessions since the pandemic started. Through the survey, the authors gathered demographic (personal and professional) information and asked questions about vicarious trauma that captured the participants’ experiences with the cumulative effects of empathic engagement with patients who have a history of trauma. The results from this study showed that 74.9% of the participants reported that they felt tired, and 47.8% reported that they had experienced having a hard time connecting to their client. On average, the therapists experienced moderate levels of vicarious trauma. Those who experienced a higher level were younger in age, had relatively less clinical experience, and had past negative experiences with remote treatment.MethodProcedureUpon receiving ethical approval from the Human Research and Ethics Committee of Long Island University (IRB Protocol 20/05–097), we recruited mental health professionals through dedicated and diverse professional listservs designed for social workers, psychologists, and art therapists. During the month of June 2020, we sent out a recruitment email that included a link to the survey. All participants signed an electronic informed consent form, which included a statement of ethics approval for the study as well as the goals of the research. Ninety-two therapists agreed to participate in an online survey that included demographic questions as well as questions about their perceptions of the therapeutic alliance and their professional and personal experiences providing remote treatment during the pandemic. For a detailed overview of the participants who participated in the survey, see Table 1.TABLES AND FIGUREStable/figure thumbnailTable 1. Descriptive Characteristics of the 92 TherapistsView larger image > in this page > in new window> Download slideAt the end of the online survey, the participants were given the option of participating in a semistructured interview (“Please provide your email address if you would like to schedule an interview of up to 45 minutes in length”). Each participant who provided their email address received a separate email in response. A total of 19 therapists agreed to participate in a telephone interview with the researchers.InstrumentFor the quantitative phase of the study, we developed an anonymous online survey with 55 questions to address the research questions. The survey was designed following the recent literature (Békés & Aafjes-van Doorn, 2020; Békés et al., 2020; MacMullin et al., 2020) and a content analysis of email messages posted on psychotherapy listservs. In the survey, we used Likert scale statements (e.g., strongly disagree, disagree, neutral, agree, and strongly agree) as options for answering the questions. Higher scores on each scale indicated greater agreement with the questions present in each scale. The survey included positively and negatively worded questions that were reversed during the analysis to increase consistency.For the qualitative phase of the study, we developed an interview guide with 15 questions that was based on the recent literature and empirical data on remote therapy during the pandemic (Békés & Aafjes-van Doorn, 2020; Békés et al., 2020; MacMullin et al., 2020). Phone interviews were conducted by the research team using a protocol that began by giving the participants an introduction to the study and was followed by asking the participants open-ended questions relating to their experiences of providing remote therapy during the pandemic. The next set of questions asked the participants to describe any changes they had observed in their relationships with their clients due to the transition to remote work. Finally, the participants were asked to share some examples of challenging moments that they had faced that would not have likely occurred had they been in their offices, as well as their thoughts and feelings about returning to in-person work.Data AnalysisProcedures for Analyzing the Quantitative DataStatistical Package for the Social Sciences (v. 27) was used to analyze the quantitative data. Reverse coding ensured that all the numerical scoring scales were in the same direction. The data were descriptively analyzed in order to demonstrate the shape, central tendency, and variability within the data set. The results section presents the valid percentage of the responses.Procedures for Analyzing the Qualitative DataA thematic analysis was undertaken (Braun & Clarke, 2006) to analyze the qualitative data. In this process, the recorded interviews were transcribed and read in order to identify concepts. After repeating these steps across all the transcripts, emerging codes and categories were compared by two reviewers (the authors), connected as appropriate, and organized into key concepts.ResultsThe majority of the participants self-identified as White women with an average age of 46.2 (SD = 18.02; range, 25–75). Of them, 80.5% (n = 74) had a social worker degree, 17.4% had a psychology degree (n = 16), and 2.1% had a counseling degree (n = 2). All of the participants had been seeing all or most of their clients face-to-face in their psychotherapy offices prior to the pandemic. The participants used both phone and online platforms, such as Zoom (n = 44, 47.8%) and Webex and Doxy (n = 23, 25%), a combination of a phone and online platform (n = 18, 19.6%), and other online platforms such as FaceTime, Skype, WhatsApp, and Google Meet (n = 7, 7.6%) to provide therapy.The results are divided into seven categories of challenges and outcomes that are “solutions” or adjustments that our participants found or made in order to cope with the difficulties they experienced because of the pandemic and the transition to remote work: (a) shared trauma, (b) adjustment without preparation, (c) psychotherapy with children, (d) Zoom fatigue, (e) lack of privacy, (f) psychotherapy with new clients, and (g) negotiating physical and relational space/re-creating boundaries. We conclude with some mixed-method data about the participants’ perceptions of transitioning back to the office in the future, which is a topic that is particularly salient to therapists given the current situation.Challenge 1: Shared TraumaChallengeThe majority of participants (60.8%, n = 56) found it difficult to help their clients cope with the trauma of the pandemic because they too were coping with their own trauma. Participant B.L. shared, “Some of my friends have died, which rocked me and made me extra sensitive.” Some participants reported that they had contracted the virus themselves and therefore had to prioritize their own health.It was inevitable that the emotional impact of the pandemic on the therapist would be a topic that would arise in sessions. Participant E.W. reported that her clients had requested more self-disclosure from her, and as a result, she felt she needed to be more revelatory about herself. The levels of stress and anxiety that participants experienced as a result of the pandemic have impacted their ability to offer the best care possible to their clients. In order to maintain the efficacy of their work throughout the crisis, it required greater personal and professional awareness on the part of clinicians.OutcomeDespite its challenges, the participants highlighted that the experience of shared trauma helped with the “bonding” process between them and their clients. Participant E.W. stated,I think it’s the closest in some ways that we get to a shared really challenging experience; some people have mentioned it even equalizes things a little bit because we’re all dealing with the same issue. This shared struggle . . . brings us closer.Participant M.K. agreed: “Some clients have asked about me for the first time ever. A little bit of self-disclosure is needed on the part of the therapist to bring them and clients closer.” She felt that her clients had begun to see her as “more human.” Similarly, Participant B.M. felt that the shared reality of the pandemic has been validating for some clients. “It levels the playing field. They are not alone in their anxiety . . . it’s like the world is resonating with them instead of them feeling out of step with the world.” The shared trauma, at least at the beginning of the pandemic, offered an example of how therapists go through the same experiences as their clients. This reality cannot be ignored, especially under the current circumstances.Challenge 2: Adjustment Without PreparationChallengeClinicians were forced to adapt to their new settings quickly. In our study, 69.6% of the participants (n = 64) agreed that conducting therapy remotely during the pandemic had been challenging for them. For some who had previous experience providing remote therapy, the transition had been easier. For most, regardless of their previous experience, the idea of working from home for an indeterminant amount of time seemed daunting. As a matter of fact, only 18.5% of the participants (n = 17) reported taking an online course/training in telehealth before or during the pandemic.For those participants who worked in institutional practices as opposed to private practices, the lack of regulations on the preferred Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)–compliant platforms through which to communicate with patients, access to medical records from personal computers, and the client’s ability to sign documents also made the transition more challenging. Participant U.G., who worked at an outpatient mental health clinic, explained, “There was a lot of confusion regarding procedures, which platforms were okay to use, how we do our notes and billing. There was a lot of panic, which made it very difficult.”OutcomeThe participants reported that it took them some time to adjust to providing consistent remote treatment. Some were reluctant at first, mainly because they had little experience using technology in their work. However, after an awkward start, they eventually became more comfortable, and using technology began to feel akin to seeing clients in the office. Nonetheless, 83.7% of the participants (n = 77) reported a notable difference between face-to-face therapy done in the office and remote therapy. Although the transition was rough for many at the beginning, clinicians eventually settled into the new routine and gained confidence in their ability to provide remote therapy. Consistent with other participants, Participant A.J. explained, “I didn’t expect it to be so easy and such a positive experience.” She had originally dreaded the transition, thinking that it would not be rewarding and assuming that it would be “terrible” and “ineffective.” She stated, “My view has changed . . . this has definitely opened up my mind toward the possibility that [remote therapy] can be workable, and for some people it’s more workable than face-to-face.”Challenge 3: Psychotherapy With ChildrenChallengeTherapists who worked with children found the transition to remote to be particularly difficult. “With the children, I think it’s just so much harder to build a therapeutic alliance. It just takes so much longer for them to get comfortable,” stated Participant A.L. “There are certain games we could play over Zoom, but it’s limited, and this is going on for so many months, so at a certain point, we kind of run out of things to play.” He noted that short attention spans, common among children, make it that much more challenging to engage them in play therapy online. Participant B.K. also found remote work with children to be challenging, mainly because it required tools that she did not have at hand, as work with this population is usually not reliant on talk therapy alone but required play therapy toys or art materials.OutcomeOvercoming the challenges relating to working therapeutically with children remotely required much more preparation, research, and adaptation in order for the remote therapy to be successful. Participant B.K. explained,Play therapy is much harder to do remotely. I had to find a virtual app to do this work, which has been a tremendous relief for them and me. The first time using it successfully with a client left me feeling elated.Therapists who worked with children have had to think more outside the box and be creative with their interventions. As part of their adaptations, participants mentioned using the share screen option on Zoom to play a game or to draw together.Challenge 4: Zoom FatigueChallengeAnother challenge reported by the participants in their adjustment process was experiencing “Zoom fatigue,” a term coined to describe the cumulative effects of using video platforms for extended periods each day (Reinach Wolf, 2020; Wiederhold, 2020). The participants in this study grew tired of staring at a screen for hours at a time each day, specifically at the beginning of the transition. Not being able to read their client’s full body language required therapists to compensate by paying especially close attention to what was in their view, such as observing eye contact or shifting in one’s seat. Participant B.M., a hospital social worker, explained, “I have to watch people’s faces a lot more. It’s hard because I have to be more present than in the room. . . . It’s more exhausting because your face is also on the screen.”“Zoom fatigue,” or “Zoom drain,” made the therapists’ days feel longer and required working harder to engage their clients. Participant M.K. described what they were missing when seeing clients through a camera: “Not to see full body presentations of clients, especially during intakes with new clients . . . you’re missing out on affect. Body language can tell a whole different story, so that’s definitely rough.” The participants explained that although they could not see their clients’ full bodies, they were able to see close-ups of their clients’ faces, which helped. Participant D.F. shared,I do not feel like I miss a lot of cues because I’m not seeing all of them; plus, in a way, the way Zoom works, you’re seeing them so close up it’s like you see every little flicker of the tiny muscles around their eyes in a way that you wouldn’t necessarily if they were sitting a normal sort of therapeutic distance from you.The camera view forced participants to be more attuned and to pay closer attention to their clients’ subtle nuances.OutcomeThe majority of our participants (89.1%, n = 82) found that having the support of their peers, supervision groups, families, and friends—as well as engaging in self-care practices, such as yoga and exercise—was extremely helpful in coping with the emotional and psychological effects of the pandemic, including Zoom fatigue. Some of the participants became involved in therapy groups online, which provided them with support and ideas and allowed them to connect with other clinicians. The participants who found remote work to be physically challenging as a result of sitting in front of a screen for many hours found it effective to spread their sessions out throughout the week instead of compressing them into 1 or 2 days a week. The participants reported that getting outside and taking walks in between sessions was helpful. One participant reported that she sometimes took naps in between sessions as a way to recharge and be more fully present with her clients. Participant Y.L. reported that she allowed herself a few minutes in between her sessions in order to ease some of the effects of Zoom fatigue.Challenge 5: Lack of PrivacyChallengeChallenge 5 is divided into two categories: (a) lack of privacy and (b) distraction. Sixty percent of the participants (n = 55) reported that they had some concerns about their clients’ privacy during therapy sessions. For example, Participant G.D. explained, “My young clients, whose family members [are] in the other room, do not feel so comfortable speaking and [have] asked me many times when can we meet in person in the office.” The participants have found the lack of privacy during remote sessions to be a significant barrier. For clients living in small, crowded spaces without access to headphones, and for children with intrusive parents, disclosure became more difficult.In addition, the participants described struggling with paying attention due to multiple distractions in the new setup, with 84.8% of participants (n = 78) reporting that they noticed when their clients became distracted during a session. In working from home, therapists have not only had to adjust to working with clients over a screen but have also had to cope with challenges that they would not likely encounter in the office. For example, the participants shared how their pets, partners, and children indirectly became part of the sessions. Participant W.S. shared one embarrassing moment that also impacted privacy: “My husband mixed up my schedule and showed up in the room during a session; I had to shoo him away without the client knowing.” Similarly, Participant S.D. explained, “My dog tends to bark at people walking by the house, so my clients have gotten to know my dog pretty well. I think it does make me seem a little bit more relatable.” In another scenario, Participant M.L. shared, “Clients get to meet my cats, which has brought up a range of reactions.”Another distraction that impacted remote work from home related to technology, for example, technological issues such as a poor Internet connection, incoming phone calls, or message notifications. Most participants agreed that choppy Wi-Fi created a lot of disruption and sometimes even stress. Participant L.T. explained, “When Zoom freezes, it’s so frustrating and interrupts the flow.” Such occurrences required participants to ask their clients to repeat what they had just shared, which affected their emotional expressions as a result and amounted to a significant disruption in the therapeutic work.OutcomeIn order to overcome privacy issues, 68.5% of the participants reported having conversations surrounding privacy (n = 63). Ninety-two percent of the participants (n = 85) used a HIPAA-compliant telehealth platform in order to protect their clients’ privacy and legally adhere to the HIPAA rules (e.g., use of approved telehealth platforms such as Zoom). When the problem of privacy was related to the client’s physical space, the therapist prompted the client to find a solution. Participant G.D. explained, “I asked her [the client] if we should change the time of the session so her parents are not home. In another case, I encouraged the client to speak about privacy with her parents.”Change of the physical setting was adapted by some of the participants. Participant L.K. suggested that clinicians ask themselves, “What do I look like to my clients? What are they seeing on their screen?” She consulted with an interior designer for tips on setting up her home workspace to look as much like her office as possible. She experimented with different lighting, backgrounds, and placements of the camera. Now, when she conducts remote sessions, she sits at her desk with an empty couch behind her so there is nothing personal on display except “maybe a candle and a lamp to warm up the room.” Similarly, Participant M.C. had to create a setup for herself that was more conducive to providing therapy, such as angling the camera so she was not displaying her entire living room but rather only a part of the wall (on which she added a few postcards for a bit of color) and a bookshelf. This felt more conducive to providing therapy by minimizing unnecessary self-disclosure and other distractions.According to the participants, their patients also found many creative ways to work around these obstacles, such as getting a noise-cancelling machine, going to the park, or sitting in their cars in order to gain a sense of privacy during sessions. This enabled them to continue sharing and growing as they had before the pandemic and the transition to remote work. Participant A.F., who works with children, gave an example of a client who wanted to talk about his confusion around his sexuality. However, living in a small apartment with several family members around meant that he was not comfortable verbalizing his feelings due to the risk of being overheard. To remedy this, the participant encouraged the client to type his thoughts in a chat box instead, because “typing felt much more safe [for the child].”Challenge 6: Psychotherapy With New ClientsChallengeBeginning a therapeutic relationship with a new client proved challenging for many of our participants. Seventy-four percent of the participants (n = 68) began working with new clients remotely during the pandemic. Participant E.W. explained, “There definitely feels like a disconnect, not seeing them in person. Especially since some of them don’t even want to do [video], so we’ve only done phone sessions, so I can’t even put a face to the name.” The participants reported that it was harder to build trust, make full assessments, establish appropriate goals, and form working alliances with their new clients over the phone or video. This was mainly related to the fact that the remote work created a sense of distance and detachment, which presented a challenge for the participants in establishing the therapeutic frame necessary to deepen the therapeutic process.Some of the participants discussed the bureaucratic issues that accompanied making the transition to remote work, such as navigating paperwork. Participant M.B. explained,I had to adjust to the opening paperwork because I had a really nice way of introducing it in a first session in person. I found a way that is minimally daunting for them, but that’s the main piece that feels different. Once the session is started, it has been smooth since everyone is used to video these days.Therefore, routine initial interactions and processes in the office setting have had to be adapted to accommodate the remote setting as therapists have taken on new clients during the pandemic.OutcomeWhile it was initially more challenging for many of the therapists surveyed to build rapport with new clients and understand the presenting problems, the participants also reported becoming more comfortable over the course of time to engage with clients remotely—especially if the sessions were conducted over a video platform as opposed to on the phone. It became easier when they found ways to introduce clients to the therapeutic frame, send intake forms via email, and speak with their clients about the challenges that come with remote treatment. It was a learning curve for both clients and therapists alike, which furthered the sense of connectedness. Sharing the feeling that they were “all in this together” was helpful for the participants as they built rapport with their new clients.Challenge 7: Negotiating Physical and Relational Space: Re-creating BoundariesChallengeThe change in the physical therapeutic space was one of the most immediate adjustments that therapists who transitioned to remote work during the pandemic were forced to make. For most participants, this transition felt like “new territory” because there were no clear guidelines on how to conduct therapy remotely from home. For example, which platform was the best to use? Should the therapist call the client or vice versa? Was there a designated space where the therapist and the client should sit during sessions? How should disturbing background noises be dealt with? How does the therapeutic hour start? Things that seemed to be self-evident in the office environment suddenly became less so over the computer.The transition to remote work introduced a relational challenge into the work as the use of a remote platform created an inherent distance between the therapist and the client. The safe holding environment of the therapist’s office was no longer there to support the clients. Participant B.K. explained that the dramatic change in the therapeutic space became a transferential issue, stating that for some clients,It’s been harder to explore because it’s a little bit of a reality piece because when such issues have come up in their treatment in the past, you can sort of be like “Look, I’m here, so let’s talk about why it feels to you like I’m not,” but now, working remotely, I’m here but I’m not here.Moreover, Participant B.M. explained one particular downside of practicing in a remote setting: “Clients are no longer able to sit in my safe space that I have for them in my office, which was very much an extension of me, really.”The participants also discussed the complexity of seeing their clients in their clients’ own homes. For some of the participants, it was advantageous to gain a literal peek into their clients’ worlds—unfiltered and in the absolute here and now. Participant M.C. described one striking example of a session in which her patient was cooking and brandishing a knife while she was talking about her partner. This act, needless to say, would not have taken place in the traditional office setting. It did, however, allow them an opportunity to explore clients’ feelings that perhaps would have not come up otherwise. Witnessing patients interact with the people—and things—in their homes offered the participants insights that simply would not have come across through talk therapy done in an office setting; therefore, it uniquely benefited the progression and depth of the work.OutcomeThe participants had to consider how the physical distance and lack of a shared space influenced the therapeutic relationship. Only 17.3% of the participants (n = 16) felt that the process of engaging clients remotely was similar to engaging clients in the office. Seventy-four percent of the participants (n = 68) reported that much more effort was required of them in order to build or maintain the therapeutic working alliance. The change in setting required them to have new types of discussions with their clients surrounding boundaries. Eighty-eight percent of the participants reported speaking with clients about their thoughts and feelings regarding the transition, which, to participants, felt like “new territory.” Many of these challenges were mediated by “learning on the go” and adapting and changing according to the participant’s positive/negative experiences. While not ideal, the participants all found ways to manage and move forward.Some participants thought that for many of their clients, being at home proved beneficial to the therapeutic work; the clients appeared to feel freer and more relaxed by engaging in therapy from the comfort of their homes in their own territories. Participant M.T.W. explained that therapy from the client’s own personal space offers them some added comfort, both physically and emotionally:I think the advantage is that these patients who suffer from complex trauma or are highly reactive—[who are now engaging in therapy from] the safety of home—is that if at any time during the session they find themselves feeling overwhelmed, then it’s perfectly acceptable to say that’s enough for today . . . and I think that having the freedom to disengage during the session has been helpful to these patients.In some cases, meeting remotely from their own personal spaces also allowed clients to go deeper with the work. As noted by Participant E.M., a trauma specialist,In-person intimacy of therapy can feel really overwhelming and the benefit of just them being able to be in their own space in the safety of their own apartment or house and then just the distance of the virtual sessions gives that little bit of space so that it’s not so overwhelming.Regarding therapy conducted over the phone that omits any visual element, Participant B.K. stated, “Clients don’t worry as much about my reactions and therefore feel freer to go deeper. It’s easier to bring up intense, scary feelings. It reproduces the analytic couch experience.” The majority of participants agreed that although the initial transition was challenging, once they found their footing, the work tended to go more smoothly.Moving ForwardThe participants were asked about their plans to return to the office to see their clients in person again. Although the desire to return to in-person sessions was common among the participants, they were also fine with continuing to work remotely until the office is a safe space to meet again. In fact, 71% of the participants would not mind continuing to see their clients remotely (n = 65).An overwhelming majority of the participants interviewed (n = 16) made it clear that if the choice were between returning to in-person sessions with a mask or other barrier or continuing to work remotely, they would without a doubt choose the latter. As Participant L.K. explained, “It’s a conundrum. I would like to be back, but then we would have to talk through a mask. What would that do? What kind of barrier will that pose? Our voices will be muffled.” Participant M.C. agreed because she enjoyed working remotely: “It takes discipline. Going back to a small office, in full PPE, an N95 face mask, going into therapy with someone who looks like they’re going into surgery. If that’s the case, I’d rather work remotely.” To add to that narrative, 55.4% of participants were sure that they would only see clients face-to-face once there was a vaccine to protect against Covid-19 (n = 51).Despite the challenges that the participants have faced by conducting remote therapy from their personal spaces, they have found working from home to offer a satisfactory solution to overcoming the problems created by Covid-19. On the whole, they felt that the advantages of working in this manner outweighed its challenges, and some have considered continuing to work remotely indefinitely.DiscussionMost likely, engaging in remote therapy from one’s personal space will continue beyond the duration of the pandemic and will become the new normal for clinicians and clients alike. Our study’s results show that therapists have been able to handle the transition to remote psychotherapy from home successfully. Our participants were able to find their own ways of coping with the transition while ensuring that their clients’ needs were prioritized. Nevertheless, there are still obstacles that should be addressed in relation to HIPAA law, confidentiality, privacy, and technology interruptions.The data analysis revealed heterogeneity in the provision of remote therapy. For example, the platform used for online sessions varied from one therapist to another, as did the device that was used; some therapists chose to begin the session by calling the client (opening the door), while others had the clients call them (client knocking on the door). Because of these and other variables, we argue that it is essential to create professional standards for providing remote therapy, particularly when it is conducted outside of the office space. While the American Psychiatric Association has collaborated with the American Telemedicine Association (American Psychiatric Association & American Telemedicine Association, 2018) to create guidelines for best practices in offering videoconferencing-based telemental health (Shore et al., 2018), these remain insufficient specifically because home is the new office. Publishing additional guidelines specific to providing remote therapy during a pandemic, as well as the preferred methods for its delivery, would prove highly supportive to both senior and junior clinicians in their work.Since our personal spaces now function as our new workspaces, not only has the physical boundary between work and home been lost, but for many, so too has the psychological boundary. This lack of separation between their work life and their personal life has sabotaged therapists’ ability to process and “decompress” in between or after sessions and made it difficult to establish boundaries. Thus, greater attention should be paid to the heightened risk of burnout and compassion fatigue among therapists due to the lack of physical and psychological separation between work and home.LimitationsOne of the limitations of this study is the fact that the sample was a convenience sample. The majority of the participants were social workers in independent practice in New York and New Jersey. As a result, the sample lacks the randomization and accuracy that is so important when conducting research. Moreover, the analysis failed to include variation between groups. Specifically, since close to 40% of the sample was aged 60 and above, there may have been differentiation in the participants’ experiences based on their age and familiarity with technology.Given that the majority of the participants in this study were social workers, future studies could consider how the pandemic has affected clinicians from other disciplines as well, specifically psychologists and psychiatrists. The anecdotal evidence shows that the experience has been similar (Békés et al., 2020; Callahan, 2020; Inchausti et al., 2020), but nevertheless, there is room to replicate this study with a disciplinarily heterogeneous population.Finally, the survey was limited in its ability to cover questions related to the confidentiality and privacy of the therapists and their clients. Maintaining confidentiality is a crucial part of the therapeutic relationship and likely jeopardized when home becomes the office and clients are deprived of access to a safe therapeutic space. Thus, further research is needed on how conducting therapy from home affects privacy and confidentiality.Implications for the Future of Psychotherapy Post-Covid-19One of the most important findings of our study is that as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, therapists, clients, managed care companies, and other significant stakeholders have been given the chance to learn that teletherapy is not only possible but also necessary. Few of the participants had received training on how to conduct therapy outside of the office during a pandemic. We recommend implementing a curriculum for students as well as clinicians that offers tools for providing effective remote therapy, specifically when it is conducted by therapists working from home. This is especially critical because Covid-19 is now our new reality, and it will likely take some time to return to what was once the normal way of working face-to-face in an office setting. We believe that such training will facilitate the work for clinicians, improve the therapeutic connection, and, most important, create professional standards for this new way of working.The results of this study also revealed different sets of challenges for therapists working with children as opposed to adults. Not being in the same physical space or having access to the games, toys, and other such tools that are essential to play therapy proved especially challenging. It required therapists to prepare for sessions by doing research in advance to find creative ways of keeping young clients engaged through play. We recommend conducting a study of the experiences of therapists who work remotely with children in order to determine what therapists have found to be most effective for maintaining the therapeutic alliance and ensuring that the quality of their work is on par with working face-to-face in the office.Finally, there is a great need to probe the possibility of making the transition back to the office and seeing clients in the office safely by relying on masks or social distancing techniques. The potential challenges related to this topic were briefly covered by the participants in this study, but it was not the main focus of the research. We believe that more information needs to be gathered in order to smooth the transition and really learn how to do it effectively.ConclusionThe learning curve for therapists conducting therapy remotely from home during a global pandemic has been steep. Mere months ago, we believed that it would just be a matter of time before we returned to “normal.” Now we understand that life with Covid-19 is the new normal. Consequently, remote therapy will remain a common method of work and perhaps even become the preferred method. Therefore, therapists will need to learn how to balance their personal and professional lives better and manage their screen time to prevent Zoom fatigue and burnout. Overall, our results show that, during the rapid transition to provide teletherapy from home due to the Covid-19 pandemic, therapists experienced some challenges related to their relationships with their clients, technology, and privacy. However, they were able to find solutions to keep their therapeutic relationships with their clients professional and beneficial. Further research and training are needed to help therapists develop best practices to more effectively build and maintain alliances with their clients when they are not in the same physical space. In early January of 2020, Chinese health authorities notified the World Health Organization (WHO) that a new type of coronavirus (COVID-19) had been identified as the cause of an outbreak of respiratory infections in Wuhan City, China. By mid-January, nearly 300 cases of the new virus had been diagnosed across China, Japan, Korea, and Thailand (WHO, 2020a). Confirmed cases of COVID-19 quickly swelled to more than 85,000 by the end of February (WHO 2020b), and by mid-March WHO declared COVID-19 to be a pandemic, with nearly 120,000 people testing positive worldwide (WHO, 2020d). In response to the rapid spread of the virus, WHO recommended that people take precautionary measures such as maintaining physical distance to reduce the risk of interpersonal transmission (WHO, 2020c), and governments, institutions, and businesses in the United States moved to online models for conducting their daily activities whenever possible (Adalja, Toner, & Inglesby, 2020).In anticipation of the possibility that the health care infrastructure could become overwhelmed, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and the American College of Surgeons (ACS) recommended that in-person routine health care visits and elective medical procedures be postponed (ACS, 2020; CDC, 2020b). Large health care organizations such as the Veterans Health Administration (VHA), Mayo Clinic Health System, and Johns Hopkins Medicine shifted toward utilizing telehealth services to meet patient needs while lessening interpatient and staff transmission risk and conserving medical supplies (Nitkin, 2020; Stiepan, 2020; VHA, Office of Emergency Management, 2020). Reports from the Chinese scientific community showed that ambiguity around COVID-19 contagiousness, prevalence, and risk, as well as mandated social isolation, have been associated with spikes in levels of anxiety, panic disorder, and depression in the general population (Qiu et al., 2020). For patients already receiving mental health care services, many original presenting problems have been overshadowed by increased fear, depression, anxiety, and panic (Perrin, Rybarczyk, et al., 2020). Public access to nonstop media coverage of the pandemic as well as exposure to social media may also have implications for increased mental health concerns (Gao et al., 2020; McDonnell, Nelson, & Schunk, 2012; United States Department of Health and Human Services Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, 2014). Furthermore, fundamental coping strategies like seeking social support to improve mental health (e.g., Harandi, Taghinasab, & Nayeri, 2017) through gathering with friends and family and at places of worship have suddenly become unavailable.Efforts to meet the health needs of new and established patients have required unprecedented measures by government agencies and other public and private systems, institutions, and companies. Since the VHA is an example of an integrated federal health system which had already been implementing and developing telepsychology prior to COVID-19, many of the barriers faced by psychologists outside the VHA system have been addressed, and its system may serve as an exemplar of how to deploy telepsychology (Perrin, Pierce, & Elliott, 2020). For example, online trainings with experienced trainers are already accessible to all providers (Caver et al., 2020). As veterans being served by the VHA are prequalified for services, reimbursement questions are largely nonexistent. Interstate practice within the VHA system is allowed, removing another external barrier to providing telepsychological services.In the VHA and more broadly, Medicare temporarily relaxed reimbursement restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic and allowed reimbursement for telemedicine visits at the same rate as in-person visits (United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services [CMS], 2020). Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) regulations were eased by the United States Department of Health and Human Services’ (HHS) Office for Civil Rights (OCR) to allow use of telecommunication apps like Skype, FaceTime, and Zoom (OCR, 2020a, 2020b). HHS also published waivers allowing telehealth providers participating in Medicare, Medicaid, and the Children’s Health Insurance Program to be reimbursed for visits with patients in states they were not currently licensed within (HHS, 2020). Furthermore, in response to declarations of emergency, psychology boards in several states including Arizona, California, and Texas suspended typical interjurisdictional requirements to allow psychologists not licensed within their state to provide treatment in their jurisdiction (California Board of Psychology, 2020; State of Arizona Board of Psychologist Examiners, 2020; Texas State Board of Examiners of Psychologists, 2020).Many professional psychology training programs and clinics moved rapidly to telepsychology with tele-supervision (e.g., Perrin, Rybarczyk, et al., 2020), and the Association of Psychology Postdoctoral and Internship Centers (APPIC) facilitated this, communicating that training hours via telepsychology could be counted the same as in-person (APPIC, 2020). Training programs were established through organizations such as the TeleBehavioral Health Institute (2020), and the American Psychological Association (APA) developed tools and resources to aid psychologists in their adoption of telepsychology (e.g., APA, 2020; Martin, Millán, & Campbell, 2020). Psychology organizations around the world, such as the European Federation of Psychologists’ Associations (EFPA) and the Australian Psychological Society (APS), also quickly developed resources for not only their members, but also consumers so they, too, could become accustomed to the idea of using telepsychology for their therapy (APS, 2020; EFPA, 2020).Pre-COVID-19 State of TelepsychologyTelepsychology, according to the APA, is the use of any of a number of telecommunication technologies to deliver psychological services (APA, 2015). Therefore, telepsychological services may run the gamut from smartphone apps meant to enhance treatment adherence (Reger et al., 2013) to Internet-based self-management tools for individuals with depression (Görges, Oehler, von Hirschhausen, Hegerl, & Rummel-Kluge, 2020) and other extensions of in-person services (Heesacker, Perez, Quinn, & Benton, 2020), to synchronous provision of audiovisual telepsychotherapy (Adler, Pritchett, Kauth, & Nadorff, 2014). Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, telepsychology was being used but in a limited capacity. Despite the availability of the technology for some time and the findings that for many psychological issues telepsychology is just as effective as in-person sessions (Varker, Brand, Ward, Terhaag, & Phelps, 2019), many psychologists had been slow to adopt telepsychology as a substantial part of their practice. Previous national-level research suggested that only about 21% of psychologists used telepsychology in their clinical practice (Pierce, Perrin, & McDonald, 2020b). An exception to this may be psychologists in the VHA, which was an early mover in telehealth and provided nearly 100,000 patients with telehealth services between 2006 and 2010 (Godleski, Darkins, & Peters, 2012). The VHA had been promoting the use of telepsychology as a way to reach veterans who would otherwise have limited access to mental health services because of geographic distance (Adler et al., 2014) and to reduce the length and frequency of psychiatric admissions (Godleski et al., 2012).Pre-COVID-19 Barriers to TelepsychologyAs telepsychology has been shown to be efficacious (Varker et al., 2019) and efficient (e.g., Adler et al., 2014; Darkins, 2016; Tadmor, McManus, & Koenig, 2006), one might wonder why it was not being utilized more extensively before the COVID-19 pandemic. A number of intrapsychic and environmental barriers to the adoption of telepsychology by psychologists have been identified. For example, many psychologists seemed to have doubts regarding the ease of using telepsychology in practice, as well as how useful it might be (Pierce et al., 2020b). Additionally, despite acknowledging its potential usefulness for therapy, approximately 75% of psychologists and other allied providers said they were not willing to refer their clients for telepsychology (Perle, Burt, & Higgins, 2014). When investigated further, a lack of self-efficacy has been evident in psychologists’ reasons for not utilizing telepsychology in their practices, as many cited insufficient opportunities for training as a major stumbling block in their willingness to go forward with telepsychology in their practices (Perry, Gold, & Shearer, 2020).In addition to intrapsychic barriers like bias and low self-efficacy, there have been many environmental barriers for those desiring to implement telepsychology. One example of an obstacle is federal security laws such as HIPAA. While enacted to protect patient privacy, in effect it limited options for telepsychology, as it precluded the use of common telecommunication applications like Skype and Facetime for the provision of telepsychology (APA, 2014). Medicare regulations are another example, as they laid out specific reimbursement qualification stipulations for telehealth sessions. For example, prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, patients were required to be in a Medicare-designated rural area and at a Medicare-specified medical treatment center in order for practitioners to receive reimbursement from Medicare for telemedicine visits. Accordingly, the American Medical Association reported that only .25% of Medicare patients received telehealth treatment (O’Reilly, 2019). State laws and regulations have also been limiters in the adoption of telepsychology; for example, most states require that the psychologist be licensed in the same state both they and the client are in at the time of treatment. Apart from legal regulations, the settings in which psychologists practice may restrict the implementation of telepsychology (Pierce, Perrin, & McDonald, 2020a) because policies and guidance on implementation are nonexistent, or there is no appropriate equipment or space available. Even when clinical settings have procured the necessary technology, technical issues on either the clinician’s or patient’s end can hinder willingness to use telepsychology.Current StudyThe flexibility and adaptability of telehealth and telepsychology services have been touted as an important part of crisis response plans, as telehealth allows professionals to provide services to hot zones rapidly or without having to be there in person at all (Darkins, 2016; Tadmor et al., 2006). This allows for efficient deployment of services when and where they are needed. The use of technology to conduct remote telepsychology sessions has very likely become more widespread because of the mandated social distancing imposed by authorities in an effort to reduce the transmission of COVID-19. The pandemic has even coincided with what some have called a “telemedicine revolution” (Perrin, Pierce, et al., 2020, p. 1), although no research to date has examined precisely how the use of telepsychology by psychologists has changed during the pandemic, nor what variables may account for the change in use. As a result, the purpose of this study was to examine (a) the amount of psychologists’ telepsychology use before the COVID-19 pandemic, during the pandemic, and anticipated use after the pandemic; as well as (b) the demographic, training, policy, and clinical practice predictors of these changes. To remain consistent with Medicare’s expanded definition during the pandemic, within the current study, “telepsychology” was defined as “the use of real-time audio (e.g., telephone) and/or video conferencing technology to provide psychological services.” It was hypothesized that telepsychology use would increase dramatically during the pandemic relative to before the pandemic, and that this increase in use would lead psychologists to anticipate continuing to use telepsychology at higher rates after the pandemic relative to baseline, though less than during the pandemic. The results of a previous study (Pierce et al., 2020a) suggested that age, gender, race/ethnicity, supportive policies, receiving training, and population density accounted for 29.8% of the variance in psychologists’ telepsychology use. The results also indicated that setting and treatment focus accounted for 5.3% and 13.1% (respectively) of the variance. These findings informed the variables chosen as predictors in the current study.MethodParticipantsPotential psychologist participants were recruited using e-mail addresses from directories of professional organizations, counseling center and mental health clinic websites, and psychology newsgroups. Eligibility requirements were that participants had to be: (a) licensed to practice as a psychologist in the United States, (b) age 18 or older, and (c) currently practicing (seeing patients) as a psychologist in the United States. Data were collected from May 11, 2020, to May 25, 2020. Initial and follow-up e-mail invitations were sent to 27,324 individuals, 3,897 of which were returned as “undeliverable,” and resulting in 3,694 participants who opened the survey. Of this number, 184 participants left after viewing the information sheet or indicated their refusal to provide informed consent, while 541 participants abandoned the survey at various points without completing it. Among the remainder, 198 individuals were not eligible to participate because they were not currently licensed or treating patients, and 127 were not included after refusing to answer demographic questions (e.g., age, years in practice). Finally, 25 participants’ data were excluded from analysis after they provided nonsensical responses to the validity check question (“In one sentence or less, what do you think the purpose of this study was?”), years of practice being equal to or less than the participant’s reported age, or years of practice reported indicating the psychologist started practicing prior to age 18. These exclusions resulted in a final sample of 2,619 licensed, currently practicing psychologists and an 11.18% completed response rate.Psychologists in this sample had an average age of 57.29 years with 35.4% identifying as men and 64.2% as women. These closely resembled APA membership demographics (57.8 years, 41.4% men, and 57.8% women; APA, 2018). The average number of years in practice was 24.22, with most individuals having an individual practice (54.4%) in a suburban (46.9%) or urban (43.9%) setting. Full sample demographics appear in Table 1.TABLES AND FIGUREStable/figure thumbnailTable 1. Summary of Participant CharacteristicsView larger image > in this page > in new window> Download slideMeasuresIn addition to demographic data about themselves, their practice location and setting, and treatment foci, participants were asked to provide responses regarding their telepsychology use, training, and organizational policies relative to January 20, 2020, when the first COVID-19 case was confirmed in the United States. Medicaid and Medicare define “telemedicine” as “two-way, real time interactive communication between the patient, and the physician or practitioner at the distant site” (United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, 2019). Medicare also makes further distinction between telehealth visits which they specify use audio and video communication between the provider and the patient. Communication using telephone only is termed a “virtual check-in” (United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, 2020). The United States Drug Enforcement Administration limits this definition of telemedicine even further to only include health care facilitated by real-time, two-way, audio/video interactions between the practitioner and their patients (United States Drug Enforcement Administration Diversion Control Division, 2019). To remain consistent with this trend and, in particular, the expansion of telepsychology reimbursement during the pandemic under Medicare, telepsychology was defined to participants as the use of real-time audio (e.g., telephone) and/or video conferencing technology to provide psychological services.The researcher-generated telepsychology questions used were: (a) “What percentage of your patient treatment is provided using telepsychology?” with answers ranging from 0%-100%; (b) “I have been trained well to use telepsychology,” with a 7-point, Likert-type scale ranging from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 7 (Strongly Agree); and (c) “My organizational policies support telepsychology,” measured on the same Likert-type scale. For all three questions, participants responded three times with regard to the following prompts: (a) “Before the COVID-19 pandemic began in the U.S. on January 20, 2020”; (b) “During the COVID-19 pandemic in the U.S.”; and (c) “Your anticipated perspective or behaviors after the COVID-19 pandemic ends in the U.S.” The amount of change for the current primary analyses was determined by subtracting participants’ responses about their telepsychology use before the pandemic from their answers during the pandemic.ProcedurePotential participants were sent a recruitment e-mail inviting them to complete a 10-min survey that would “help inform treatment approaches used during the pandemic, as well as public healthcare policy.” To avoid biasing enrollment based on preconceived notions of telepsychology, no reference to telepsychology was made in the recruitment e-mail. Additionally, all potential participants received a reminder e-mail one week after the initial invitation was sent. If the providers elected to participate, they had to agree to an informed consent document before being directed to the Qualtrics web platform and screened for eligibility. Participants completed a number of demographic questions about themselves and their practice, read the telepsychology definition used in this survey, and then answered the questions about telepsychology.Data AnalysisAll analyses were conducted using SPSS (Version 26.0). Significance was established at an alpha level of .05, two-tailed. A repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was conducted in which the predictor variable was time (3 levels: before the COVID-19 pandemic, during the pandemic, and projected after the pandemic), and the criterion variable was percentage of clinical work performed via telepsychology.Then, four ANOVAs were conducted examining the effects of primary treatment setting on (a) prepandemic percentage of clinical work performed via telepsychology, (b) that percentage during pandemic, (c) that percentage projected after the pandemic, and (d) change from percentage of clinical work performed via telepsychology before the pandemic to the percentage during the pandemic. These ANOVAs included only participants who worked in primary treatment settings selected by 25 or more participants, and participants who chose the “other” designation were excluded. For these four ANOVAs only, this resulted in not including participants who worked in correctional facilities, geriatric facilities, psychiatric hospitals, rehabilitation centers, residential treatment centers, or other practice settings.Finally, two multiple regression analyses were conducted to examine the statistical effects of (a) participant demographics, change in workplace telepsychology policy, change in telepsychology training, practice geographic area, and (b) treatment focus on the change in the percentage of clinical work conducted via telepsychology before relative to during the COVID-19 pandemic. In both regressions, the criterion variable was the percentage of clinical work conducted via telepsychology during the pandemic minus the percentage conducted via telepsychology before the pandemic. The first model’s predictors included age, gender (1 = woman, 0 = man or transgender or nonbinary), race/ethnicity (1 = White/European American, 0 = racial/ethnic minority), the relative change in perceived organizational support via telepsychology policies, relative change in perceived levels of telepsychology training received, and the geographic area type where the practice was located (1 = rural vs. 0 = urban or suburban). The second model’s predictors included dummy-coded variables representing a variety of issues and diagnoses the psychologists’ treated within their practice.ResultsChanges in Telepsychology Use Over TimeThe repeated-measures ANOVA examining the effects of time on the percentage of clinical work performed via telepsychology was statistically significant, F(2, 2617) = 8254.01, p < .001, partial eta-squared = .863, a very large-sized effect. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, psychologists performed 7.07% (SD = 14.86) of their clinical work with telepsychology, 85.53% (SD = 29.24) during the pandemic, and a projected 34.96% (SD = 28.35) after the pandemic. These changes represent a more than 12-fold increase in percentage telepsychology use during the pandemic relative to before the pandemic.Additionally, 45.70% of psychologists reported not using telepsychology at all before the pandemic, with 84.99% reporting using it for 0–10% of their clinical work. Conversely, during the pandemic, 96.45% of psychologists reported using telepsychology in their practice, with 6.61% reporting using it for 0–10% of their clinical work; 67.32% of psychologists reported going completely virtual during the pandemic, with 77.63% reporting using telepsychology for 90–100% of their clinical practice. After the pandemic, 89.19% of psychologists anticipated using telepsychology in their clinical practice (though at just over one third of clinical work).Primary Practice SettingThe results of the series of one-way ANOVAs comparing the percentage of telepsychology use and change in that percentage by psychologists’ primary practice settings appear in Table 2.TABLES AND FIGUREStable/figure thumbnailTable 2. Percentage Use of Telepsychology by Primary Practice SettingView larger image > in this page > in new window> Download slideBefore the COVID-19 pandemic, psychologists in Veterans Affairs (VA) medical centers and individual practices had the highest percentage use of telepsychology. Psychologists in outpatient treatment facilities and academic medical centers reported the lowest. During the pandemic, psychologists in group and individual practices had the highest percentage use, although that use was only higher than the lowest percentage group, psychologists in a hospital/medical practice. The largest increase in percentage telepsychology use during the pandemic occurred in group practice, particularly relative to the low percentage increases in hospital/medical practice and VA medical centers. However, in terms of fold increase, psychologists in outpatient treatment facilities reported over a 26-fold increase, followed by psychologists in an academic medical center who reported over a 23-fold increase; by contrast, psychologists in VA medical centers only reported just over a sevenfold increase. After the pandemic, there were no statistical differences between groups, although in terms of the means, psychologists in VA medical centers projected that they would use telepsychology the most in their practice.Demographics, Training, and Organizational PoliciesThe first multiple regression provided a statistically significant prediction of change in telepsychology use during the COVID-19 pandemic relative to before, F(6, 2612) = 34.94, p < .001, R2 = .074, a small-sized effect. When controlling for the other predictors, women increased their telepsychology use by 5.8% more than men or transgender/nonbinary individuals (p < .001). Psychologists practicing in rural locations increased their telepsychology use 4.1% less than psychologists practicing in urban or suburban locations (p = .046). Each whole increment increase in telepsychology training rating points resulted in an additional increase of 3.3% in telepsychology use (p < .001). Each whole increment increase in supportive telepsychology organizational policies rating points resulted in an additional increase of 1.6% in telepsychology use (p < .001). No other predictors exerted a unique effect (Table 3).TABLES AND FIGUREStable/figure thumbnailTable 3.

Significant Variables in Multiple Regression 2View larger image > in this page > in new window> Download slidePsychologists who treated antisocial personality disorder, who performed testing and evaluation, and who worked with rehabilitation populations had the lowest increases in percentage telepsychology use. Conversely, psychologists treating relationship issues, anxiety, and women’s issues had the highest increases in percentage telepsychology use.DiscussionThe current study is among the first to examine United States psychologists’ percentage of clinical work performed via telepsychology before, during, and projected after the COVID-19 pandemic, and to examine demographic, training, policy, and clinical practice predictors of these changes. This study is notable in that it drew data from a large national sample of 2,619 licensed psychologists currently practicing within the United States. Results supported hypotheses that use of telepsychology would significantly increase during the pandemic relative to prepandemic rates, and that psychologists would anticipate continuing to use telepsychology after the pandemic at higher rates than at baseline, though less than during the pandemic. Subsequent analyses also demonstrated the statistical effects of specific demographic, training, policy, and clinical practice characteristics on the change in use of telepsychology, suggesting that psychologists may be differentially able or willing to incorporate it into their own practice.These findings document an unprecedented shift in the uptake of telepsychology, as rates of utilization increased dramatically during the pandemic. Consistent with previous national research demonstrating low rates of telepsychology use with only about one fifth of practicing psychologists using telepsychology in their practice (Pierce et al., 2020b), psychologists in the current study estimated performing 7.07% of their clinical work with telepsychology before the pandemic. This is in stark comparison to psychologists’ estimates that telepsychology comprised 85.53% of their clinical work during the pandemic, an over 12-fold increase. Moreover, participants projected that 34.96% of their clinical work would be conducted via telepsychology even after the pandemic ceases, reflecting an important shift in attitudes toward the use of telepsychology. This represents a nearly fivefold increase from prepandemic rates, indicating the high likelihood of long-lasting changes in the use of telepsychology even after COVID-19-related concerns are ameliorated. These results serve to illustrate the telemedicine revolution (Perrin, Pierce, et al., 2020, p. 1) occurring with practice, policy, and attitudes toward telepsychology during the COVID-19 pandemic. Psychologists reported increasing the percentage of their clinical work via telepsychology at record rates, even within the VHA, where training and infrastructure have been in place for over a decade (Godleski et al., 2012).These results are also notable because they document the efforts of practicing psychologists to meet the increased mental health needs of the public. Research has already recorded increases in symptoms of anxiety and depression in the general population during the pandemic (Gao et al., 2020; Qiu et al., 2020), while simultaneously observing decreased access to traditional coping strategies (Harandi et al., 2017) and in-person options for health care (e.g., ACS, 2020; CDC, 2020b). Telepsychology presents an opportunity for psychologists to meet many patients’ mental health needs while supporting efforts to limit virus transmission.Overall, psychologists in group and individual practices reported the highest percentage use of telepsychology during the pandemic, though these percentages were only statistically different from psychologists in a hospital/medical practice, who reported the lowest percentage use. Psychologists in group practice reported the largest increase in telepsychology use during COVID-19 relative to baseline, with smaller increases in use observed in hospital/medical practice and VA medical centers. Within the VHA, lower change in percentage use was likely due in part to the higher-than-average rates of telepsychology use before COVID-19, and perhaps the level of bureaucracy involved in implementing additional changes relative to more nimble practice settings. These results suggest differential abilities of psychologists to introduce or increase telepsychology practice based on primary practice setting.Certainly, many commonly cited barriers to telepsychology were addressed on a national scale, such as privacy and security regulations (APA, 2014; OCR, 2020a, 2020b), Medicare reimbursement (Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, 2020), and training (e.g., APA, 2020), which likely impacted the universal increases in percentage of telepsychology use documented here. However, these findings also suggest that psychologists in group practice had access to the support needed to transition to telepsychology in conjunction with fewer procedural obstacles to overcome, and that working within a group practice provided opportunities for psychologists to address remaining environmental and individual barriers to uptake. For example, while psychologists have previously reported concerns about ease of telepsychology use (Pierce et al., 2020b), access to other practitioners within the group and/or administrative personnel may have increased the likelihood that typical concerns were readily addressed, particularly if a colleague was already using telepsychology. Further, new policies and guidance on telepsychology may have been more quickly and easily implemented within a group practice in comparison to a hospital system or VA medical center, where the more complex policy-making infrastructure may have slowed implementation.Results also supported previous research findings (Pierce et al., 2020a) that uptake of telepsychology during the pandemic would relate to several demographic variables. Woman-identified gender, nonrural practice setting, increased organizational policies supporting telepsychology, and increased training in telepsychology were all associated with increases in percentage of telepsychology use. Age and race/ethnicity were not associated with changes in telepsychology service provision. Despite the lack of age effects, the mean age and experience of the sample indicate that many participants probably trained in an era with less video conferencing technology; therefore many of these psychologists likely learned this approach and adapted rapidly during the demands of the COVID-19 pandemic.These findings have several important implications. First, the finding that psychologists who self-identified as women showed greater increases in percentage of telepsychology suggest that gender role variables may have affected these changes. For example, given that women tend to provide the majority of childcare (Bianchi, Sayer, Milkie, & Robinson, 2012), woman-identifying psychologists with children may have experienced a greater need to increase telepsychology use in order to facilitate provision of care at home after schools and childcare options were closed. Psychologists in rural locations may have experienced a lower demand for telepsychology, as initial rates of COVID-19 cases were generally higher in more populated states (CDC, 2020a). Previous research indicates rural psychologists have been less likely to use telepsychology within their practice (Pierce et al., 2020a). With that in mind, rural psychologists eager to offer their expertise to help areas more severely affected by the pandemic may experience the added benefit of filling openings within their schedules (Centore & Milacci, 2008). Rural psychologists or their patients may also have had limited access to technology required for telepsychology such as reliable high-speed Internet. The findings regarding training and policies underscore the importance of adequate organizational support in addressing both environmental and intrapsychic barriers to telepsychology use. This is reinforced by the finding that psychologists in VA medical centers reported higher percentage use before COVID-19 than psychologists in all other primary practice settings except individual practice, given VHA’s history of telepsychology infrastructure and accessibility of training (e.g., Caver et al., 2020).Finally, the current study explored therapeutic issues and diagnoses associated with increased telepsychology use during the pandemic in comparison to telepsychology use prior to the pandemic. These results suggested that some presenting concerns may be less amenable to clinical work via telepsychology, or that psychologists treating these issues experienced greater concerns about the use of telepsychology. It should be noted that while the overall regression model uncovered a medium-sized effect, the unique effects within the model were quite small and should be interpreted through that lens. The findings might suggest that psychologists believe that complex or severe symptomatology such as antisocial personality disorder, behavioral issues, and bipolar disorder may be more difficult to treat via telepsychology or may require specialized training for psychologists to feel comfortable adapting treatment to telepsychology; psychologists may also be reluctant to treat these issues via telepsychology because of perceived safety concerns. Traumatic brain injury and physical medicine and rehabilitation may be difficult to treat via telepsychology because of the need to coordinate care with in-person services like medical examinations and physical therapy. Testing and evaluation were also associated with lower increases in telepsychology uptake, which could indicate limited access to tests adapted for telepsychology use and concerns regarding test security. In contrast, anxiety, relationship difficulties, sleep/insomnia, and women’s issues were associated with greater increases in telepsychology uptake. To some extent, this finding may be impacted by increased rates of problems in these areas related to COVID-19 and therefore to increased demand for services. However, these results also suggest that these issues may be particularly amenable to treatment via telepsychology or that psychologists are more open to providing services for these concerns using telepsychology.Clinical and Training ImplicationsThe substantial changes in percentage of telepsychology use observed in the current study suggest that many of the previously documented barriers to telepsychology have been addressed, at least on a temporary basis, either by procedural changes or by the immediate needs of patients and providers during the COVID-19 pandemic. While some facilitating changes may be short-lived, these results also show that psychologists plan to continue using telepsychology at greater rates in the future relative to before the pandemic, suggesting important shifts in attitudes toward the use of telepsychology. Adequate training in telepsychology and supportive organizational policies and procedures appear to be an important component in increasing use, and are likely to continue to be a crucial factor in maintaining telepsychology use after risks of in-person health care associated with COVID-19 have lessened. A number of training resources exist, including trainings and tools published through the APA (e.g., APA, 2020), VHA, and others. In terms of training, it is surprising that psychologists within academic settings were not using telepsychology more often prior to the pandemic, and that they anticipated after the pandemic that they would be using it less than psychologists within individual practice, group practice, hospitals, and VA medical centers. Students enrolled in professional psychology training programs may benefit from access to information and training with telepsychology as an integral part of the curriculum.These findings also highlight factors associated with less substantial increases in telepsychology use that could serve as targets for future interventions to support telepsychology uptake. This study found that woman-identifying psychologists and those in nonrural primary practice settings were most likely to increase telepsychology use. Future research could explore in greater detail barriers to uptake in psychologists who identified as men, transgender, or nonbinary, as well as psychologists in rural practice settings, and additional training or supportive policy changes could be implemented to address these discrepancies if appropriate. Moreover, future interventions and research could be targeted at clinical issues associated with lower rates of uptake; for example, the findings regarding testing and evaluation suggest a need for valid computer adapted assessments that patients can complete from their homes without violating administration norms or test security practices.Limitations and Future DirectionsThe findings from the current study should be interpreted within the context of several limitations. The observational nature of the study precludes causal inferences about patterns in telepsychology use and uptake. Thus, although the study found demographic and practice-related predictors of increases in rate of telepsychology use, these variables are not necessarily causally related. Also, the recruitment method resulted in an 11.18% rate of completed response. Although this is typical for completion rates for emailed web survey invitations (Liu & Wronski, 2018; Petrovčič, Petrič, & Lozar Manfreda, 2016) and the sample demographics closely mirrored APA membership demographics (APA, 2018), there may be meaningful difference between those who opted to participate and those who did not. A large number of participants were excluded due to not providing informed consent, not completing the survey, or providing invalid answers to survey questions. Since the survey did not collect identifiable information (e.g., e-mail address, IP addresses) or use digital cookies to track and store progress, participants were required to complete the survey all at once, rather than saving progress to return later. Therefore, a substantial number of those not included (541 participants) may have abandoned the survey to attend to something else or experienced technical issues. Although no mention of telepsychology was made in the recruitment e-mail, it could be that those individuals who started but did not complete the survey differed in some way from other participants on views of telepsychology or psychotherapy practice. Also, there was small representation in the sample from psychologists practicing within correctional facilities, geriatric facilities, psychiatric hospitals, rehabilitation centers, and residential treatment centers. These settings typically have higher levels of in-person contact with the population they treat since their patients often reside on site. The study would have greatly benefited from the views of psychologists working within these environments.Since data for the current study were collected in May 2020 during the first wave of the pandemic, additional research is needed to determine whether the results will hold if the pandemic persists for longer than originally projected, or if additional waves of positive cases occur. For example, if the United States continues to experience high rates of positive cases in the absence of a widely available vaccine or effective treatments, it is possible that rates of telepsychology use may continue to increase, as patients may feel that they can no longer wait to access services.The survey questions did not ask participants to differentiate between their use of video-conferencing and telephone in the definition of telepsychology (“real-time audio (e.g., telephone) and/or video conferencing technology”), which was consistent with CMS definitions. Some psychologists may have communicated answers differently based on each delivery method, so future research should not only document rates of telepsychology use, but also nuances therein such as delivery methods and type of clinical work performed (e.g., psychotherapy vs. assessment). Although age was not revealed to be a significant predictor of change in telepsychology use during the pandemic, there may have been differences between younger and older participants in the type of telepsychology they use. These analyses also did not examine participants’ level of competency with telepsychology or ask about specific content within any training they have received. Future studies may consider exploring these topics.Also, this study was generally conducted from the vantage point that increased adoption of telepsychology is advantageous for the field and the public. As a result, variables were not included that could have shed extensive light on the limitations of telepsychology, such as barriers to adoption, negative feedback reported by patients, impact on clinical care, and so forth. Future research should attempt to assess for variables reflecting the limitations of telepsychology, rather than just its potential. Finally, the current study partly relied on psychologists’ recall of how often they were using telepsychology before the pandemic. Previous research has demonstrated that individuals’ recall of activities and experiences are affected by multiple recall biases (Solhan, Trull, Jahng, & Wood, 2009). Although psychologists were asked about overall telepsychology use just a few months prior, their answers concerning certain activities in their daily practice may have been distorted. Similarly, the current study assessed psychologists’ predictions in the percentage of their future clinical work that would be conducted via telepsychology, future policy impacts on telepsychology are not yet known. For example, it is unclear whether privacy/security regulations will be amended after the pandemic or will revert to prepandemic rules, and whether telepsychology services will continue to be reimbursed at rates comparable to in-person services. These policy changes may have substantial impacts on psychologists’ availability and attitudes toward offering telepsychology, even as self-efficacy and ease of use may increase over time. Additionally, ongoing research is necessary to evaluate the impact of these policy decisions on psychologists’ service delivery in order to ensure that the mental health needs of the general public are adequately met. Millions of people with a diagnosable mental disorder within the United States do not have adequate access to trained mental health professionals. Areas classified as rural contain an estimated 60 million people (U.S. Census Bureau, 2018), while most psychologists, social workers, and psychiatrists work within the wealthier neighborhoods of population-dense cities (Kazdin & Blase, 2011; U.S. Department of Health & Human Services, 2013). Furthermore, states with higher proportions of individuals with a mental illness also have a smaller proportion of psychologists to treat them (American Psychological Association [APA], 2014). This limits access to treatment for millions of people unable to attend in-person sessions with competent mental health professionals. The U.S. Health Resources & Services Administration (2020) reports that 112 million people are living within areas with a shortage of mental health providers and services.Telepsychology can be an important piece of the puzzle as psychologists attempt to reach people for whom time, distance, or situation are barriers to receiving traditional in-person psychotherapy. The APA (2015) defines telepsychology as providing psychological services through the use of technology. Although this can include the use of text, chat, e-mail, telephone, virtual reality, or even websites providing self-help information (Chester & Glass, 2006; Murphy & Mitchell, 1998), this article will focus solely on the delivery of psychotherapy through the use of videoconferencing technology.Numerous studies indicate telepsychology can be as effective as in-person interventions. Backhaus et al. (2012) conducted a meta-analysis of 65 research articles comparing interventions delivered via telepsychology with the same interventions delivered in person. Their results suggested that interventions using telepsychology were comparable to in-person psychotherapy in regards to patient satisfaction, symptom outcomes, and feasibility across a diverse sample (Backhaus et al., 2012). Equivalency in effectiveness was also observed by researchers conducting a meta-analysis of 24 randomized controlled noninferiority trials comparing telepsychology with in-person interventions for disorders such as depression, anxiety, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and adjustment disorder (Varker, Brand, Ward, Terhaag, & Phelps, 2019). It is important to note that a majority of the studies evaluating the efficacy of telepsychology utilize some form of behavior or exposure therapy and focus on treating symptoms of depression, anxiety, or PTSD. With that said, there are a variety of other treatments that have been successfully delivered via videoconferencing, suggesting that it can be broadly used to treat a range of patients (K. E. Anderson, Byrne, Crosby, & Le Grange, 2017) and with a range of approaches (Kobak, Lipsitz, Markowitz, & Bleiberg, 2017). The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has sustained a long commitment to telehealth and telepsychology to reach veterans across the country and has even developed their own telehealth platforms (VA, 2020).Although many psychologists may prefer to meet with their clients in person for every session, making this a requirement may reduce access to treatment. People with very limited time, restricted travel options, physical impairments, impaired cognition, or the inability to transfer caregiving responsibilities to others may have to forgo traditional in-person sessions (Savege Scharff & Martin, 2018). Considering the rich body of research suggesting a reciprocal relationship between mental and physical health (Cacioppo & Berntson, 2012; Dantzer, 2018; Herbert & Cohen, 1993), the traditional in-person requirement for mental health services places an unfair mental and physical toll on entire communities. A potential benefit that telepsychology may offer is the potential to mitigate these issues and enable psychologists to regularly meet with clients where they already are (Savege Scharff & Martin, 2018). Telepsychology can also increase access to psychologists with experience and training with a particular diagnosis, relevant cultural competency, or fluency in the client’s preferred language (Hailey, Roine, & Ohinmaa, 2008; Yellowlees, Marks, Hilty, & Shore, 2008). While states such as Texas, North Carolina, and Kansas have large, ethnically diverse populations living in rural areas, relying solely on in-person interventions could limit access to competent care (U.S. Census Bureau, 2016). Rather than depending on the particular competencies of practitioners within a reasonable driving distance, a person using telepsychology could potentially access any licensed psychologist within their state. Additionally, a federal rule in 2018 allowed VA-connected patients to access any VA health care providers, including psychologists, located across the country (VA, 2018). This allows VA-connected patients to receive care from providers in other states and even allows patients to receive care within their own home by using the VA Video Connect system. This change has the potential to expand the provision of highly specialized services to a greater percentage of veterans across the country regardless of their location and their ability to travel to a facility offering the health care services they need.The APA (2015) released a set of standards to guide psychologists engaging in telepsychology. Many of these are extensions of previous standards but have additional requirements for delivering psychological services using technology. For example, psychologists not only need competency using and gauging the appropriateness of interventions but also must develop competency with the technology used to deliver the interventions. These standards are vital as a guide for psychologists, but the added complexities they add are important to consider when evaluating telepsychology’s place within a practice. This may mean some psychologists are deterred by the need to gain a basic proficiency using computer networks, experience with specific telecommunications equipment such as digital cameras and microphones, and competency using the software connecting them with their clients during sessions (APA, 2015). Since access and proficiency with technology can greatly vary between clients, Wells et al. (2020) suggest scheduling a pretreatment session and building in additional time for appointments to handle technical issues and to determine alternate plans when available technology is insufficient. See Wells et al. (2020) for an excellent review of technical and practical issues to consider, as well as suggestions to address them. Furthermore, psychologists should also know if the populations they treat, and the methods they use, have been empirically demonstrated as appropriate and compatible with telepsychology. Additionally, psychologists may be concerned about shouldering additional risks to confidentiality associated with transmitting data over public networks and meaningfully informing their clients of these risks. Finally, a suitable plan must be in place in the event the network connection fails or when a client is in crisis, including knowledge of emergency services and important contacts within the client’s area (APA, 2015).Adding to the list of potential telepsychology deterrents, reimbursement for telepsychology sessions from public health care programs and health insurance providers can be difficult. For example, in 2016, Blue Cross Blue Shield only reimbursed for telepsychology visits if the psychologist was a member of an online provider’s network (Blue Cross Blue Shield, 2016). Until recently, Medicare would cover telehealth and telepsychology visits only if the client lived in a designated rural area and the session occurred within a health care facility. In 2019, the requirements were modified to allow telepsychology sessions when the client is at home if they are receiving treatment for substance abuse or a co-occurring mental health disorder. Additionally, starting in 2020, Medicare Advantage Plans may also cover telepsychology treatment no matter where the client is located (U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, 2020a). To increase access to vital care services, states such as Arizona and California have passed legislation requiring insurers cover telepsychology visits, although there are often differences in the specifics (California Insurance Code, 2011; Telemedicine Reimbursement Parity Act, 2016).The increased risk of unknowingly practicing across state lines (i.e., interjurisdictional practice) that comes with telepsychology can also be an issue. The client’s location during the session, and not that of the psychologist, determines which state’s laws are applicable (Kramer, Kinn, & Mishkind, 2015). If a client is traveling out of state but fails to inform the psychologist, the psychologist may be practicing without a license unless they meet the interjurisdictional requirements of the state where the client is located (Association of State and Provincial Psychology Boards, 2020). Even when the psychologist is notified that a patient is in a different state, the laws and requirements can vary greatly between states. Researching and complying with these differences between states could be particularly burdensome for psychologists treating patients who frequently travel to various states.Also, among the list of potential deterrents is that technological issues with the equipment and network infrastructure used for telepsychology can interfere with interactions during sessions. Network latency (i.e., lag) creating delays of 500 ms or more can negatively impact the conversation (Tam, Carter, Kiesler, & Hodgins, 2012), as both individuals are more likely to inadvertently talk over one another or experience longer than usual pauses during the conversation (Kurita, Lai, & Kitawaki, 1994). Also, if one party’s microphone is picking up the audio signal from speakers, the other party can have significant trouble speaking while hearing their own voice played back to them with a significant delay (i.e., delayed auditory feedback; Yates, 1963). Furthermore, camera placement can impact the interpersonal experience. It is common to position cameras above the video screen, but this causes each participant to see the other participant looking down rather than making eye contact. To address this, a number of gaze correction solutions have been developed, but they can be expensive and introduce distracting or even disturbing video artifacts such as flickering seams around the face as elements of the head image are shifted (Chen, 2002; Khan, Li, & ur Réhman, 2016; Kuster, Popa, Bazin, Gotsman, & Gross, 2012). This may be especially problematic when utilizing psychodynamic approaches relying on the therapist’s ability to carefully create a setting and situation in which the patient can openly express themselves (Essig & Russell, 2017; Savege Scharff & Tao, 2018).Previous research has examined the concerns and training needs of psychologists and doctoral psychology students. Within a sample obtained by Perle, Burt, and Higgins (2014), 74.1% of psychologists indicated they were not likely to refer anyone for telepsychology. Participants indicated that they were most concerned about information regarding ethics, legal issues, evidence of effectiveness, strategies for crisis management, reimbursement, costs, and setup. Further research also revealed mental health providers’ adoption of evidence-based practice is influenced by practice setting and organizational culture (Aarons, 2004), age, race/ethnicity, and gender (Aarons et al., 2010).In early 2020, authorities within the Chinese health system notified the World Health Organization (WHO) that they had detected a new virus strain, termed “COVID-19,” among their population (WHO, 2020a). On January 20, 2020, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed that a patient in Seattle, Washington, who had recently visited China had tested positive for COVID-19 (Holshue et al., 2020). Within a few weeks, more than 118,00 individuals testing positive for COVID-19 had been detected worldwide, leading WHO to declare the virus a global pandemic (WHO, 2020b). In response to anticipated health care needs and to facilitate social distancing to slow transmission rates, multiple agencies within the United States adjusted key policies to promote the use of telehealth and telepsychology to meet demand for services. The Office for Civil Rights within the Department of Health and Human Services suspended the Privacy Rule within the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act that had previously prevented the use of several commonly used teleconferencing platforms such as Skype and FaceTime (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2020a, 2020b). Medicare and Medicaid temporarily adjusted their policy to reimburse all telehealth and telepsychology visits at the same rate as in-person visits, as well as allowing telepsychology visits within patients’ homes (U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, 2020b). Health care providers such as Johns Hopkins (Nitkin, 2020), Mayo Clinic (Stiepan, 2020), and the VA (2020) announced policy changes to promote and meet the unprecedented need for telehealth and telepsychology services.Psychologists exploring the possibility of telepsychology within their practice have quite a bit to consider. Among these concerns are efficacy, legal issues, organizational policies, additional training, client safety, reimbursement, telepsychology’s potential impact on the therapeutic relationship, and the financial costs that come with it (Perle et al., 2014). Examining these complex and interrelated issues may help explain why, before the COVID-19 pandemic, an estimated 80% of psychologists had never used telepsychology. Building on previous research examining the concerns and training needs of psychologists (Perle et al., 2014), the purpose of this study is to collect and categorize a comprehensive list of telepsychology deterrents identified by psychologists not currently using it before the COVID-19 pandemic and then identify significant practice and demographic predictors of psychologists’ reported concerns about telepsychology. The current study is a secondary data analysis using data from a previous study examining theoretical models predicting psychologists’ use of telepsychology (Pierce, Perrin, & McDonald, 2020).MethodParticipantsEligibility requirements for participants were that they (a) were 18 years or older, (b) were licensed to practice psychology in at least one state within the United States, (c) were currently practicing psychology, (d) had earned a doctoral degree, and (e) were not currently using telepsychology within their practice. A recruitment list was compiled using online rosters of professional organizations (e.g., APA), psychology newsgroups (e.g., Society for Military Psychology, Society for Counseling Psychology), and publicly available information provided on mental health provider websites. The list included 28,276 names and e-mail addresses of individuals who were potentially practicing within the United States as a psychologist. Data were collected between July 6, 2017, through July 26, 2017. E-mailed invitations to the list resulted in undeliverable notifications from 16.1% of the list, while delivered invitations led to 2,138 (9.0%) of individuals completing the survey. This rate of response aligns with previous research examining response rates and completion rates for e-mailed web surveys (Liu & Wronski, 2018; Petrovčič, Petrič, & Lozar Manfreda, 2016). This study was reviewed by the Virginia Commonwealth University Independent Review Board to ensure it was conducted ethically and in compliance with all federal, state, and local regulations concerning research involving human participants. Survey answers were reviewed to find meaningless answers to free response items, unlikely responses, and impossible answers. Two responses were discarded because the entered years in practice and stated age suggested the respondent started practicing at or before age 2. Another 347 survey responses were discarded based on blank or meaningless answers to a final free-response validity check question. This question was used to detect participants who were providing quick and nonsensical answers to reach the end. One record was discarded since the respondent indicated they were only licensed to practice outside of the United States. Finally, 389 respondents indicated they were currently using telepsychology within their practice. This resulted in a sample of 1,400 participants (see Table 1)TABLES AND FIGUREStable/figure thumbnailTable 1. Summary of Participant CharacteristicsView larger image > in this page > in new window> Download slidewith representation from each state and Washington, DC.ProcedureInvitations to participate were e-mailed directly to a list of potential participants. The invitation explained why they were invited to participate, a brief description of the study’s purpose, the criteria for participant inclusion, and an HTML link. Recruits who clicked on the HTML link were taken to a page with more details about the study, institutional review board information, methods for contacting the authors, and an informed consent form. Once the recruits consented to the study, they were taken to an online survey designed using the Qualtrics (2017) platform. The first four questions asked participants to verify that they were over 18 years of age, have a doctorate in psychology, are licensed to practice psychology somewhere within the United States, and are currently practicing as psychologists. Before continuing, they were presented with the following statement, “For the purpose of this survey, ‘telepsychology’ refers the use of video conferencing technology to provide psychotherapy.” The remainder of the survey asked them to provide demographic data about themselves, information about their practice, and details about their concerns, attitudes, and perceptions concerning telepsychology. As a final check for validity, participants were asked to provide a response the question, “In one sentence or less, what do you think the purpose of this study was?”MeasuresDemographicsSurvey items recorded participant responses concerning their age, years in practice as a psychologist, the number of psychologists in their place of practice, their theoretical approach to psychotherapy, if they currently use telepsychology, the primary focus on their practice (e.g., eating disorders, addiction, depression, family conflict, racial identity), the states they are licensed to practice within, and the density of the community (urban, suburban, or rural setting). Race/ethnicity was indicated by selecting from a predefined a list of forced choices comprising White/European American (non-Latino/non-Hispanic), Black/African American (non-Latino/non-Hispanic), Latino/Hispanic, Asian/Asian American (non-Latino/non-Hispanic), American Indian/Alaska Native/Native American, multiracial/multiethnic, and “other.” The item capturing theoretical approach responses offered a list of forced choices, including Acceptance and Commitment, Cognitive Behavioral, Existential, Family Systems, Feminist, Gestalt, Individual/Adlerian, Interpersonal, Jungian, Narrative, Person-Centered/Rogerian, Psychoanalysis, Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy, Reality Therapy, Solution-Focused Therapy, and “other.” Participants who selected “other” were provided a text box and asked, “please specify.”DeterrentsParticipants were asked, “If you DO NOT currently use telepsychology, what led to this decision (select all that apply)? (State laws prohibit its use, Organizational policies prohibit its use, Client Safety/Crisis concerns, Cost, Efficacy, Ethics, Privacy, Legality, Reimbursement, Insufficient training, Other [Please specify]).” Participants were allowed to select multiple items.ResultsDescriptive AnalysisTo summarize psychologists’ deterrents to using telepsychology, percentages of psychologists in the sample who endorsed the researcher-provided options were calculated. In order to analyze the responses to the “Other [Please specify]” item, an eight-step qualitative analysis process described by Zhang and Wildemuth (2009) was conducted. The initial set of codes and descriptions were the researcher-provided options listed above. Two raters familiar with the telepsychology literature reviewed the 402 responses to the survey’s “Other [Please specify]” item. The two raters independently sample-coded a random selection of items, frequently consulting the list of codes for guidance. Each rater’s sample or responses was compared with one another and resulted in an interrater reliability of 79.2%. The raters discussed areas for improvement. The descriptors were modified for greater clarity, and three pairs of codes were combined, resulting in the final list of 16 codes (see Table 2).TABLES AND FIGUREStable/figure thumbnailTable 2.

The remaining items were coded by each rater while they frequently reviewed the list of codes to maintain consistency. Upon completion, the results were compared. A third person reviewed the responses for which there was disagreement and served as a tiebreaker while also frequently consulting the list of codes and descriptions. These data were combined and analyzed with data obtained from the list of researcher-provided options (see Table 3).TABLES AND FIGUREStable/figure thumbnailTable 3. Percentage Endorsed of Each Telepsychology DeterrentView larger image > in this page > in new window> Download slideLogistic RegressionsA series of binary logistic regressions were used to model the most frequently endorsed (20% or more) binary variables of deterrents (with not endorsing the deterrent as the reference category; Table 4).TABLES AND FIGUREStable/figure thumbnailTable 4. Variables in Logistic RegressionsView larger image > in this page > in new window> Download slidePredictor variables included participant age, as well as binary predictor variables of masculine gender (man), White/European American race/ethnicity, practicing within a rural community, practicing within a VA or medical center, and using cognitive–behavioral therapy (CBT) as a treatment approach to therapy.TrainingThe first logistic regression model did not provide a statistically significant prediction of psychologists endorsing insufficient training as a concern, χ2(6) = 9.132, p = .166.SafetyThe second model provided a statistically significant prediction of endorsing safety as a concern, χ2(6) = 27.193, p < .000. The Nagelkerke pseudo-R2 indicated the model accounted for approximately 2.8% of the total variance. When controlling for the other predictors, the likelihood of endorsing safety as a concern for psychologists who did not use telepsychology was lower for cisgender men, White psychologists, practitioners within a VA or medical center, and those using a CBT approach. No other predictors exerted a unique effect on endorsing safety as a concern.PrivacyThe third model provided a statistically significant prediction of endorsing privacy as a concern, χ2(6) = 33.722, p < .001, Nagelkerke pseudo-R2 = .035. The likelihood of endorsing privacy as a concern was lower for cisgender men, those practicing within a rural community, and those practicing within a VA or medical center.Legal issuesThe fourth model provided a statistically significant prediction of endorsing legal issues as a concern, χ2(6) = 19.546, p = .003, Nagelkerke pseudo-R2 = .021. The likelihood of endorsing legal issues as a concern was lower for older psychologists, those practicing within a rural community, and those who practiced within a VA or medical center.EthicsThe fifth model provided a statistically significant prediction of endorsing ethical issues as a concern, χ2(6) = 22.284, p = .001, Nagelkerke pseudo-R2 = .023. The likelihood of endorsing ethics as a concern was lower for those practicing within a VA or medical center.ReimbursementThe sixth model provided a statistically significant prediction of endorsing reimbursement as a concern, χ2(6) = 15.123, p = .019, Nagelkerke pseudo-R2 = .016. The likelihood of endorsing reimbursement as a concern was lower for older psychologists.EfficacyThe seventh model provided a statistically significant prediction of endorsing efficacy as a concern, χ2(6) = 49.573, p < .001, Nagelkerke pseudo-R2 = .054. The likelihood of endorsing efficacy as a concern was higher for older psychologists but lower for those practicing within a VA or medical center and those using a CBT approach.DiscussionThe purpose of this study was to collect and categorize the concerns psychologists have regarding telepsychology and to examine demographic and practice characteristics that predict psychologists’ endorsement of those concerns. This is important for mental health since telepsychology has the potential for reaching people in need of mental health services but who are limited by time, distance, or circumstances from attending in-person sessions. While many hospitals and health care institutions within the United States have adopted telehealth of some kind (U.S. Department of Health & Human Services, 2016), prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, an overwhelming majority of practicing psychologists did not offer telepsychology as an option for their clients (Perle et al., 2014; Pierce, Perrin, & McDonald, 2020). This study helps clarify the most important deterrents psychologists face when considering telepsychology within their own practice.The results indicate that psychologists not using telepsychology primarily chose not to do so because they believed the effectiveness of treatment would be diminished and that they had concerns about exposing their clients to increased risks. These concerns included receiving insufficient training to be effective with telepsychology, ensuring the client’s safety or addressing the needs of remote clients in crisis, protecting the privacy of clients, considering ethical issues that could result from using telepsychology, and being uncertain about the effectiveness of treatment when not conducted in person. Among less frequently endorsed concerns were understanding and addressing legal complexities, reimbursement concerns, organizational barriers, a perceived lack of demand, and the additional financial costs or time commitment that could result from telepsychology adoption. The large proportion of individuals citing concerns about legal and reimbursement issues suggests that advocacy efforts to examine and adjust these systemic issues could result in more frequent use of telepsychology when it is appropriate. In this light, it is not surprising these barriers were recognized and addressed by swift federal changes to policy in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.The results suggest that psychologists practicing within medical centers or VA facilities were less likely to endorse safety, privacy, legal issues, ethics, and efficacy as concerns when compared to psychologists in other settings. The adoption rate of telehealth (the use of technology to deliver health care services) within hospitals has been increasing over the past several years (Huilgol, Miron-Shatz, Joshi, & Hollander, 2020). The VA reports more than 2 million telehealth visits occurred during the fiscal year of 2016 (VA, 2017). As psychologists see their colleagues use this option to treat clients, it is reasonable that they would have diminished concerns about its efficacy. Also, VA and medical centers often have carefully crafted, well-communicated policies and guidelines to protect patient privacy and safety. For example, the VA requires practitioners to complete several courses explaining how to use their telehealth platforms, as well as information about legal issues, VA policies, and best practices concerning telehealth visits (Caver et al., 2019). It is understandable that psychologists within these settings would feel more confident that they can address these issues and find answers if necessary. Furthermore, psychologists within a VA setting are operating within a large health care system with its associated resources (e.g., veterans’ crisis line, medical center emergency departments at VA medical centers, suicide prevention coordinators, standardized safety plans, high-risk intervention teams) to address urgent needs as they arise. Finally, federal laws allowing VA psychologists to provide treatment to VA patients regardless of their location within the United States would dampen concerns about legal issues.Also, older psychologists were less concerned about reimbursement issues and more concerned about the effectiveness of using telepsychology. Predictably, age and years in practice were highly correlated within this sample. It may be that older, more experienced practitioners better understand how to work with insurance providers to ensure they get paid for their services. On the other hand, when compared to younger groups, older individuals have been shown to be less comfortable being open and vulnerable when using online social platforms (Gibson et al., 2010) and are more likely to perceive online relationships as shallow (Jung, Walden, Johnson, & Sundar, 2017; Lehtinen, Näsänen, & Sarvas, 2009). Psychologists possessing these beliefs and attitudes who choose not to use telepsychology may be making a decision based in part on the perceived importance of in-person connections to facilitate interpersonal interactions, therapeutic alliance, and vulnerability. It may be that these fundamental assumptions regarding what needs to happen within the therapy relationship (e.g., alliance), as well as assumptions concerning the ability to achieve these requirements while using telepsychology, may be at the core of the issue for these psychologists. Further studies examining if these assumptions regarding the ideal nature of the therapy relationship can be met using telepsychology, and disseminating the results to practitioners, could have an impact on future use. Also, future studies on receptivity toward telepsychology may consider examining broader attitudes toward social media and online relationships.Those who engaged in CBT were also less likely to report efficacy and safety as deterrents to adopting telepsychology than psychologists using other approaches to psychotherapy. The lower concerns about efficacy and safety, two sides of the same coin, may be partially accounted for by noting the high number of studies using CBT to examine telepsychology’s effectiveness. A meta-analysis conducted by Varker et al. (2019) reviewing studies of telepsychology’s effectiveness revealed that CBT was the most common approach utilized. As Johnsen and Friborg (2015) suggest, this may be the result of how highly standardized CBT has remained for decades, lending itself well to studies comparing outcomes between groups. On the other hand, it may be that, for some unexamined reason, CBT is simply better suited for telepsychology than other theoretical approaches to psychotherapy. The results may suggest that telepsychology efficacy literature would benefit from future noninferiority studies utilizing a more diverse representation of theoretical approaches.Finally, among psychologists not using telepsychology, being White was not seen as a consistent predictor of most of the issues raised. Although Whites were statistically less likely to endorse safety as a concern, this result may be spurious considering the fluctuating direction of results across the list of concerns analyzed. Future research may attempt to validate, and if replicated, attempt to understand this result.Limitations and Future DirectionsAlthough this study provides some insights concerning psychologists’ concerns about telepsychology, it has some limitations to consider. To begin with, the data were gathered before the COVID-19 pandemic. There have been major changes to the environment within which psychologists evaluate telepsychology. The need for social distancing, as well as the adjustment of multiple laws and policies, has led to unprecedented levels of telepsychology and telehealth usage (Pierce, Perrin, Tyler, McKee, & Watson, 2020). As psychologists gain training and experience with telepsychology, it may have a significant impact on their attitudes concerning its effectiveness and appropriateness with the populations they treat. The experience gained during this period can guide organizations and training programs as they develop education for psychologists that takes into account the populations they treat, the setting they practice within, approach, and so on. For example, Wells et al. (2020) provide an excellent overview of lessons learned delivering prolonged exposure therapy using telepsychology during the pandemic. A future follow-up study could survey psychologists to see which, if any, of these barriers or concerns persist and to what degree.Another limitation is that the sample was skewed on certain factors such as race/ethnicity. There was an overrepresentation of White participants (90.3%) and participants practicing in individual or group practice (65.6%) when compared with the percentage of APA members who are White (84%; Lin, Stamm, & Christidis, 2018) or work in independent practice (K. Stamm, Lin, & Christidis, 2017). The use of Internet-based surveys can be problematic in that they may unintentionally result in a skewed sample of the population. Although steps were taken to ensure participants were engaged throughout the entirety of the survey, and a large sample was obtained, research utilizing Internet surveys faces difficulties when attempting to control who ultimately decides to participate (T. Anderson & Kanuka, 2002; Leary, 2012). Although the sample was sufficient for achieving significance in one category concerning race/ethnicity and treatment setting, the sample lacked sufficient diversity for a more nuanced analysis. The interaction of race/ethnicity and attitudes toward telepsychology are likely to be very complex and may be impacted by individual-, community-, and systems-level factors that are worth exploring but not able to be handled effectively with this study’s data. Further exploration of factors such as the perspectives on telepsychology’s impact on social justice, disparities in resources impacting access, or access to psychologists with greater cultural competence in areas where that may not be available deserve further exploration.Next, some deterrent categories may be underrepresented. There were four categories added during the qualitative analysis based on typed responses to the “other” category. Although 28.6% of participants did take time to enter items not listed, it is likely these categories would have been endorsed more often had they also been included as an easy to select checklist item. The final list is likely to contain the majority of concerns psychologists have when considering telepsychology and might serve as a guide for future exploration.An additional limitation is the lack of data from psychologists who do use telepsychology within their practice. Without those data, it is not clear what deterrents vary across the different groups. For example, both groups may have concerns about safety or reimbursements but may vary on prohibitive organizational policies within the institution in which they practice. Future studies could ask about barriers and deterrents for both those who do use telepsychology and those who do not.A final limitation of this study is that the total variance explained by the logistic regression models ranged between 1.6% and 5.4%. Although most of the models achieved statistical significance, the revealed differences between groups were small. As a result, the interpretation of these results should be tempered.ConclusionThe study revealed several important deterrents reported by psychologists who are not currently using telepsychology. Insufficient training was endorsed as the most common deterrent to using telepsychology. Providing more information and training resources could potentially encourage more psychologists to consider its use and provide more mental health care access to populations that traditional in-person approaches do not currently reach. In particular, more academic institutions might consider adding training in telepsychology to their programs as they prepare psychologists to meet the public’s mental health needs. Not doing so may unknowingly communicate negative messages concerning its use. The results also suggest that, among psychologists who do not use telepsychology, their concerns slightly vary depending on demographic and practice characteristics. Organizations interested in promoting or implementing telepsychology might benefit from tailoring programs to address specific needs of the psychologists they work with rather than adopting a “one-size-fits-all” solution. There is a worldwide gap between the mental health needs of children and adolescents and them receiving treatment (Kieling, Baker-Henningham, Belfer, et al., 2011; Patel, Kieling, Maulik, & Divan, 2013), one that has been exacerbated by the COVID-19 crisis (Duan & Zhu, 2020; Lee, 2020). Under normal circumstances, fewer than a quarter of children with mental health disorders are appropriately identified as needing services (Jensen, Goldman, Offord, et al., 2011). This includes at least 15% of U.S. students struggling with learning and attention problems and needs that go unidentified, unaddressed, and unmet (Cortiella & Horowitz, 2014). The COVID-19 crisis has largely curtailed the evaluation of mental health and educational needs (Pfefferbaum & North, 2020), meaning even more learning difficulties will go unidentified.There are many barriers to children receiving assessment and treatment for mental health and learning needs, one of which relates to limited access to appropriate services. Access to services is also rife with structural inequities (Kastrup, 2019; Saxena, Thornicroft, Knapp, & Whiteford, 2007), and disasters tend to both highlight and exacerbate such inequities (Yun, Lurie, & Hyde, 2010). School psychologists are generally less available in rural areas, as well as overwhelmed in suburban and urban areas (Clopton & Knesting, 2006; Myers et al., 2010). Especially vulnerable to not receiving adequate psychoeducational services are children of color (Morgan, Farkas, Hillemeier, & Maczuga, 2012; Morgan et al., 2015), in part because of less general access (Flores, 2010; Inkelas, Raghavan, Larson, Kuo, & Ortega, 2007). Not just limited to academic and mental health evaluations, during the COVID-19 crisis, those from the most vulnerable populations have the least access to services they need (van Dorn, Cooney, & Sabin, 2020).Between an identified shortage of school psychologists in rural areas (Castillo, Curtis, & Tan, 2014; Fagan, 2004; Gadke, Valley-Gray, & Rossen, 2016) and many school psychologists, who spend the overwhelming majority of their time doing psychoeducational testing and related services (Curtis, Chesno-Grier, Abshier, Sutton, & Hunley, 2002; Reschly, 2000) working at over twice the capacity recommended by the National Association of School Psychologists (2010), a redistribution of resources is necessary. Prior to COVID-19, there was a call for assessment services provided in schools to be comprehensive, widely available, and even more utilized, despite the challenges of access (Cummings et al., 2004). In the era of COVID-19, there has been a specific call for students with learning challenges and other disabilities not go unevaluated and thus unsupported, despite even greater structural challenges (Wright, 2020).While not without challenges and necessary adaptations (Alami, Gagnon, & Fortin, 2019), telehealth has the potential to significantly redistribute (especially geographically, but also socioeconomically) mental health and psychological testing resources (Grady, 2012). Online mental health services, and specifically Internet-based testing, have been championed because of the potential for improved access by overcoming many practical constraints (Barak, 1999; Berends et al., 2004; Young, 2005). Internet-based and videoconferencing assessment services have been used globally with children and youth (Boydell et al., 2014; Lingely-Pottie & McGrath, 2006; Reed, McLaughlin, & Milholland, 2000), largely to fill in gaps in access in areas with greater demand than local service providers are able to meet (Boydell et al., 2014; Cruz, Krupinski, Lopez, & Weinstein, 2005; Elford et al., 2000; Myers, Valentine, & Melzer, 2007, 2008; Pesämaa et al., 2004, 2007). However, a disproportionate burden has been placed on performance-based cognitive (and other) assessment, especially during this COVID-19 crisis moment, when providers are being forced to adapt much more rapidly than research agendas will allow. Cognitive and other performance-based measures are harder to adapt to a remote, online format than, for example, counseling services, and with student need continuing without pause, there is no time to wait for robust bodies of research to renorm tests in this new format.Remote, online administration of cognitive measures has the potential to increase access to these services by redistributing the workforce. During the COVID-19 crisis, in many places in the United States, it will be the only option, if services are to continue. Even though some general guidance has been provided for how to adapt tests generally to a remote, online format (Wright, Mihura, Pade, & McCord, 2020) during the COVID-19 crisis, this is not a replacement for systematic research on the equivalence of testing in this format to a traditional, in-person administration.Given the range of psychological processes engaged during the course of a typical cognitive (intelligence) evaluation (Kovacs & Conway, 2019), altering the format of administration could in theory alter the tasks, and thus the emerging data, significantly. Some of these alterations and their likely effects are more obvious, such as stimuli being shown in different formats (on an upright screen, as opposed to a flat stimulus book or tablet). Some may be more subtle, though, such as a change in the interpersonal interaction between examiner and student in this format, interaction with a proctor on the student’s side, or potentially students being able to see themselves in the telehealth platform. Each of these has the potential to affect students’ performance on tasks. However, efforts need to be made to try to approximate standardized, in-person administration as closely as possible. Adaptations can include some modifications to administration prompts, where and how stimulus materials are presented on the screen, and how to coach and use a proctor at specific moments in administration. To evaluate the effectiveness of these alterations, they should be consistent and standardized, just as examiners are taught to adhere to standardized administration procedures in traditional testing.Two issues become especially salient in the delivery of remote, online performance-based assessments. First, it becomes much more difficult to maintain test security and integrity, mandated in the psychology ethics code (American Psychological Association, 2017). While psychologists never have full control over test security, it is important that they take reasonable steps to protect it (Wright et al., 2020), including explicitly telling clients and proctors that screen recording and screenshots are not allowed. Having a proctor present (as was the case in the present study) significantly reduces the ability for clients to compromise the security and integrity of tests.Second, the requirement for clients to have reliable, high-speed Internet access and appropriate technology can amplify structural inequities in our society (Wright et al., 2020), with the most vulnerable and high-need populations having the least access to assessment (and other) services (Yun et al., 2010; van Dorn et al., 2020). Although it may be beyond assessment psychologists to solve these larger societal inequities themselves, having the option to conduct even remote, online assessments in a neutral, equipped place, such as a school (again, as was the case in the present study), can mitigate the barriers that vulnerable populations may face in accessing tele-assessment services.The Wechsler Intelligence Scales for Children, in their continually updated forms (currently the fifth edition; WISC-V; Wechsler, 2014a), are internationally the most widely used test with children and adolescents (Oakland, Douglas, & Kane, 2016). It often serves as the basis for learning disability evaluations (Oakland et al., 2016), attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder evaluations (Moura, Costa, & Simões, 2019), and other issues, such as intellectual developmental disorder, giftedness, and autism spectrum disorder (Miller et al., 2019). It already has a history of some adaptation for new technology, as it was adapted and tested for equivalency using the Q-Interactive system, utilizing iPads to display administration information and record forms for the examiner and stimulus materials and response forms for students (Daniel, Wahlstrom, & Zhang, 2014). Adapting the WISC-V for use in a remote, online administration environment has the potential for increasing access to this widely used test in significant ways, especially during the COVID-19 crisis.Present StudyThe present study aimed to evaluate the equivalence of two administration procedures of the WISC-V: the traditional, standardized, in-person administration and remote, digital, online administration (entirely remote, using a telehealth platform). The equivalence of data captured by remote, online administration and traditional, in-person administration was evaluated. The goal was to evaluate both index and subtest standard scores, to determine if there was a significant impact of the method of administration, to determine if the current normative and psychometric information from the traditional, in-person test development could be applied to the remote, online format. It must be noted that this study evaluated a very specific set of protocols for delivering remote, online administration of the WISC-V. The generalizability of any findings should be limited to trained test administrators who follow the specific protocol examined, as closely as possible, including specific digital platform requirements, examiner training, and use of an informed in-person proctor.MethodEquivalence Study DesignFor the present study, a case control match design was utilized, in which examinees took the WISC-V in only one format (traditional, in-person or remote, online). While a matched design required a larger sample, it avoided testing effects of test-retest or alternate forms designs. That is, when an examinee answers either the same type of problem or the exact problem more than once, learning may have occurred (of the problem-solving strategy or the content) that can alter the performance the second time. The case control match design created two groups that were matched on specific variables/characteristics (in this case age and gender), each group receiving only one format of test administration, as would be the case in clinical practice. Therefore, two groups roughly equal in number, matched on age and gender, were created, with examinees randomly assigned to one of the two groups. The Kaufman Brief Intelligence Test, Second Edition (KBIT-2) was also administered in the same administration format (traditional, standardized, in-person) to all participants to be able to pair participants on IQ to better ensure equivalent groups.ParticipantsThe sample consisted of 256 children, ages 6 to 16, who were recruited by between December 2019 and April 2020 in varied regions across the country (12% from the Midwest, 18% from the Northeast, 40% from the South, 15% from the Southeast, and 15% from the West). Participants were recruited from schools with demographic characteristics similar to a general school population and were not specifically screened for any specific disorders (intellectual, learning, or otherwise), to maintain generalizability to the general population. However, there were no participants with specific hearing, vision, or physical impairments in the present study. Case control matching (on age and gender) was used for the study. Participants were randomly assigned to either remote, online administration or traditional, in-person administration of the WISC-V, with roughly equal numbers in each cell by age and gender (see Table 1).TABLES AND FIGUREStable/figure thumbnailTable 1. Demographic Characteristics of the SampleView larger image > in this page > in new window> Download slideIt should be noted that because of the COVID-19 crisis, data collection was stopped before the full intended sample could be evaluated; as such, the cells were not entirely equal in the case control matched design.Table 1 reports demographic characteristics of the sample. The subgroups taking the WISC-V with standard or remote administration were very similar. Overall, there was roughly equal representation of males and females, across administration formats.MeasuresKaufman Brief Intelligence Test, Second Edition (KBIT-2)The KBIT-2 (Kaufman, 2004) is a brief, individually administered broad intelligence measure consisting of three subtests. Two subtests, Verbal Knowledge and Riddles, compose a Verbal scale, and one subtest, Matrices, composes a Nonverbal scale. Together, the three subtests contribute to a general IQ composite score. The test and its scales have exhibited good internal consistency and appear to measure what they purport to measure (Bain & Jaspers, 2010), with particular strength of the IQ composite.Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, Fifth Edition (WISC-V)The WISC-V (Wechsler, 2014a) is an individually administered, multisubtest, performance-based intellectual ability test for children aged 6–16. The widely used measure produces an overall full-scale IQ, as well as multiple index scores for component domains of intellectual functioning. The test has exhibited strong reliability of its scores and validity of its score interpretations in its traditional, standardized format (Dombrowski, Canivez, & Watkins, 2018; Na & Burns, 2016; Wechsler, 2014b), especially noted for its strong validity evidence base as a measure of general intelligence.ProcedureAll procedures of the present study were approved by PresenceLearning’s research review committee, which oversees human protections and research ethics. Examiners were school and clinical psychologists qualified and experienced in administering the WISC-V and KBIT-2, as well as the use of the telehealth platform that was specifically configured for the administration of psychological tests. As each participant was scheduled for testing, they were randomly assigned to either the traditional, in-person or the remote, online administration format, with the requirement that the cases within each Age × Gender “cell” would be divided generally equally between the formats.For the present study, all stimulus materials for the WISC-V were provided by Pearson in PDF format for the ability to present it via screen presentation (they have made these materials temporarily available more widely during the COVID-19 crisis via qglobal.pearsonclinical.com). Therefore, no physical stimulus book was needed for the remote, online administration procedure, nor was a document camera to project stimulus materials from physical stimulus books from the examiner’s side to the examinee. Examinees needed to have at least a 13-in. monitor to maintain size commensurate with the printed stimulus books, and this was verified ahead of time.Each examinee first took the KBIT-2. Every examinee was administered the KBIT-2 in the same format: traditional, paper-and-pencil format. Then each examinee took the complete WISC-V, in standard test sequence, in the assigned format (remote, online or traditional, in-person). For the purposes of this study, remote, online administration was simulated, using different rooms within the same setting (most often two different rooms within the participant’s home, the examiner’s home, or in a school office setting). The same examiner administered the WISC-V as had administered the KBIT-2, with a 15-min break between them (regardless of format), to standardize fatigue effects across the two groups. Typically, both the examiner and participant were connected to the same Internet connection, which may have reduced some potential technological hitches that can arise from unreliable Internet connectivity on either or both ends of the tele-assessment dyad.Examiners’ scoring decisions were used in the present analysis for any test that required immediate scoring (to determine reaching basals and ceilings/discontinues, for example), to determine whether examiners’ decisions were affected by format. That is, any test that needed immediate scoring utilized immediate scoring, and each was checked afterward for accuracy by a member of the research team, to determine if the administration format affected how accurate these scoring decisions were. All subtests that did not require immediate scoring were scored after the fact by the research team, and all raw scores were entered into the WISC-V online scoring program via Q-Global, regardless of administration format, in the same manner. Data were reviewed for quality by examining any potential outliers and data entry mistakes (e.g., scores that fell outside of the possible range), and entry errors were corrected.Proctors (in-person assistants used in the remote, online administration procedure) were recruited from different sources. Of note, they were not psychological professionals and at no time performed any task that required prior training or a clinical background. They did no demonstration of any items or any other actual assessment function. The proctors received a <10-min preparatory lesson about what to expect and how and how not to interact with the examinee and examiner and received a written guide about how to facilitate the setting up of the cameras on the examinee’s side. Specifically, the proctors were used to verify that the video and sound were working properly on the participants’ end of the assessment before the evaluation started, handing the participants physical items (like blocks and response booklets) for younger participants, and providing overall safety supervision (having an adult in the room in case of an emergency). Specifically for block design, for younger examinees, the proctor picked up and dropped the blocks between items; older examinees were instructed to do so, and in both cases the examiner prompted if and when the scrambled blocks needed to be adjusted. When the proctor was not completing one of these tasks at the direction of the examiner, they were asked to sit in the back of the room, out of the examinee’s line of vision, and within eyesight of the examiner on the videoconferencing platform, so that the examiner could verify that the proctor was not interacting at all with the examinee or administration of the test.Data Analysis PlanGroup equivalence was first explored by comparing the KBIT-2 index and IQ composite scores (all of which were collected by traditional administration of the KBIT-2) of the two different groups (online vs. traditional administration of the WISC-V groups), using both significance tests (p values of t tests) and Cohen’s d. The standards of p ≥ .05 and d < 0.2 (in accordance with the recommendation of Cohen, 1988) were used as the standard for equivalence of the independent groups. Cohen’s d is calculated as the difference between mean scores on the two different administration formats, divided by the pooled standard deviation of scores.Then, participants were paired on the KBIT-2 IQ composite, to create more specific paired comparisons by IQ level. The whole sample (N = 273) was sorted and matched on the KBIT-2 IQ composite. Of the entire sample, 85 in-person/online pairs (N = 170; 62.3% of the sample) were able to be matched exactly on the IQ composite. Another 20 pairs (N = 40; 14.7% of the sample) were able to be matched within an IQ composite score difference of 1. For each of these pairs, they were counterbalanced with another pair, such that one had an IQ composite difference of 1 with online administration higher, and one had an IQ composite difference of 1 with in-person administration higher. Another 20 pairs (N = 40; 14.7% of the sample) were matched the same way, but with an IQ composite difference greater than 1, but still counterbalanced by administration method. Another three pairs (N = 6; 2.2% of the sample) were identified and matched to ensure that IQ composite scores at the extremes were included, and these three pairs were counterbalanced together (such that one pair had a difference of 24, with online administration being higher, and the other two pairs had differences of 9 and 15, with in-person administration being higher). Seventeen cases (6.2% of the sample), primarily from the average IQ range, were left unmatched in the final sample and were excluded from analyses (see Table 1 in the online supplemental materials for information on excluded cases). This process resulted in a final analysis sample of 128 pairs (N = 256).To evaluate equivalence in the current study, a two-one-sided-tests (TOST) procedure was employed (Lakens, 2017; Richter & Richter, 2002; Schuirmann, 1987; Seaman & Serlin, 1998). The TOST is a stringent analysis (more so than a t test or using the minimally detectable difference) that uses a confidence interval (CI) within a predefined bound, called the smallest effect size of interest (SESOI), to determine that two conditions’ measured differences are statistically negligible, and thus the conditions are equivalent. The TOST procedure uses a 90% CI to test for equivalence at the p = .05 level. While some have advocated that the SESOI for health and psychosocial factors should equal 0.5 SD (Norman, Sloan, & Wyrwich, 2003), the present study utilized a more stringent metric, opting for 0.3 SD, widely used to represent a low effect size. This stricter SESOI is a far narrower difference than the precision of the scores themselves, based on standard error of measurement (see Wechsler, 2014b, p. 61). As such, for index scores (M = 100, SD = 15), the 90% CI (Richter & Richter, 2002) of the paired difference between traditional, in-person administration and remote, online administration must fall between a lower bound of −4.5 and an upper bound of 4.5 (90% CI [–4.5, 4.5]) to be considered equivalent (at an alpha of .05). For scaled scores (M = 10, SD = 3), the paired-difference CI must fall between a lower bound of −0.9 and an upper bound of 0.9 (90% CI [–0.9, 0.9]) to be considered equivalent.ResultsRandomization CheckGiven the case control matching by age and gender for the two groups, with random assignment, there would be no expectation of large or systematic differences between the groups. To confirm this, the KBIT-2 scores (given in identical administration formats) were analyzed for independent group differences (before pairing participants).

All of the indices’ CIs fall within the threshold for equivalence (−4.5, 4.5), demonstrating no significant effects of the difference in administration on scores. The difference score CIs for all subtest scores except one also fall within the threshold for equivalence (–.9, .9), again demonstrating no significant method effects. The exception is Letter–Number Sequencing, which revealed significantly higher scores for those who were administered the WISC-V in the traditional, in-person format, as compared to their remote, online counterparts.Tables 5TABLES AND FIGUREStable/figure thumbnailTable 5.

Intercorrelations of Core Subtest and Index Sores for the Remote, Online Administration GroupView larger image > in this page > in new window> Download slidepresent the intercorrelations between subtests and index scores on both the KBIT-2 (index scores only) and the WISC-V, separated by administration type. Similar patterns of intercorrelation emerge for the traditional, in-person group and the remote, online group. First, there are low to moderate correlations among all the subtests and indices, expected as all tasks measure at least to some degree a general intelligence factor (g). The subtest components that comprise the indices generally correlated as expected, more strongly with each other than with other subtests and indices. For example, for both administration groups, the Coding and Symbol Search subtests correlate moderately with each other, with the Processing Speed Index (which is expected, as they are included heavily in the calculation of it), and the Full-Scale IQ, with very low correlations with any other subtest or index. The similar intercorrelations suggest that the test data maintained their general factor structure in the remote, online administration procedure, when compared to traditional, in-person administration.To evaluate the statistical significance of any differences in correlations between the two administration procedures of the WISC-V, a modified asymptotic approach to calculating CIs for the difference between the nonoverlapping, dependent correlation coefficients was employed (Zou, 2007). Each WISC-V correlation was examined for significant difference between mode, and several correlations emerged as significantly different. However, these significant differences were generally either at the between-subtest level or the subtest-nonrelated-index level (see Table 2 in the online supplemental materials, presented with Fisher-z-transformed correlation coefficients). None of the correlations at the index and full-scale IQ level emerged with significant differences between administration methods. As such, the structure of the measure is generally equivalent between the two administration methods.DiscussionThe present study aimed to evaluate the equivalence of an online, remote administration procedure to traditional, in-person administration of the WISC-V. There were no exhibited method effects for the different modes of administration in this nonclinical sample on any index score or the full-scale IQ. Additionally, most subtests administered saw no significant difference by administration method, with the exception of Letter–Number Sequencing. This subtest is a supplemental subtest and does not contribute to the overall full-scale IQ or any index score. The results from this particular subtest, though, should be interpreted with caution. Specifically, results may represent a slight underestimate of scores that would be obtained from traditional, in-person administration of the test.No mediating mechanisms for potential differences were examined in the present study. As such, there is no way to know why scores differed on this subtest, despite the stimulus materials being among the more similar between methods (Letter–Number Sequencing uses only auditory stimuli). Many subtests with more obvious alteration in stimulus materials, such as Matrix Reasoning or Visual Puzzles (with the stimulus pictures digitized into the screen in front of them and situated in a different orientation than either the traditional administration or the Q-Interactive administration, both which present the stimuli lying flat on the desk in front of the student), were not affected by administration procedure. Further research is needed to determine the underlying mechanisms for these differences.While more data should be collected to compare the two administration methods, especially with specific clinical populations, the present study suggests that the scores elicited by the two different administration methods are mostly equivalent and interchangeable, and as such all the WISC-V normative and psychometric (reliability, validity, utility) research can be applied confidently to the new online, remote administration of the test.LimitationsThe present study has several significant limitations. The most important limitation is the generalizability of the sample. Specifically, the present study utilized a general school sample, rather than a sample from a specific clinical population, so generalizability is limited. Different clinical samples, however, may have specific interaction effects with the digital platform for the online, remote administration, which should be considered when interpreting scores in clinical populations. Similarly, the present study did not collect an abundance of demographic data, including racial and ethnic background, and the overwhelming majority of participants had parents with at least some college experience. It is not necessarily a nationally representative sample, though care was taken to recruit from different geographical regions.Further, the present study does not comment on the equivalence of all online, remote administrations of cognitive tests with their traditional, in-person analog. That is, the exhibited equivalence of this specific procedure for this specific test (the WISC-V) does not imply equivalence for another procedure used with the WISC-V, nor does it imply equivalence of online, remote administration of other tests. The online, remote administration of the WISC-V in the present study adhered to very specific, rigorous protocols (with regard to digital specifications, specific training for examiners and coaching of proctors, and standardized administration modifications). The equivalence of remote, online administration that does not adhere to these protocols has not been determined. However, especially when constraints are present, the results of remote, online administration of the WISC-V, even slightly outside of the administration procedures used in the present study, are likely to be useful and usable. Ethical interpretation of scores that emerge from even slight alterations in this standardized protocol require careful consideration (Wright et al., 2020).ConclusionOnline, remote administration of cognitive and intellectual tests like the WISC-V has the potential to significantly increase access to important evaluations. This is true during this COVID-19 crisis, during which a great deal of assessment has halted entirely, as well as during more “normal” times, when there are shortages and inequities of access to evaluation. Being able to test students online allows for a redistribution of resources within states, allowing for access in remote areas (without hours of travel time) and lightening of caseloads in more densely populated environments. Students who need psychoeducational evaluations should have them, even during a pandemic, and they should have them in a timely fashion. The remote, online use of the WISC-V can help achieve that goal. Telepsychology also called telemental health, or telebehavioral health is broadly defined as the delivery of behavioral health services via technological means, typically across a distance. Telepsychology can be performed in real time (synchronous) or as a delayed correspondence (asynchronous). Within large organizations such as the Department of Defense (DoD), Indian Health Service, and Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), video teleconferencing (VTC) is the most common means of telepsychology. Globally, telepsychology is used to deliver care to remote areas or postdisaster settings. For example, in 2010, telepsychology was leveraged to provide services to Haitians following a devastating earthquake (Augusterfer, Mollica, & Lavelle, 2015).An important aspect of telepsychology is its utilization in the provision of effective treatments to those at facilities where access to care is limited due to provider shortages and the uneven distribution of low density specialized providers (e.g., pediatric psychiatrists). Research on telepsychology has demonstrated favorable findings related to both process variables (i.e., satisfaction and rapport; Gros, Lancaster, López, & Acierno, 2018; Morland et al., 2015) and outcome variables (Bashshur, Shannon, Bashshur, & Yellowlees, 2016). High treatment acceptability and credibility has also been found with an older adult population (Egede et al., 2016). Randomized trials (Nelson, Barnard, & Cain 2003; O’Reilly et al., 2007; Ruskin et al., 2004) as well as less rigorous studies (Frueh et al., 2007; Tuerk, Yoder, Ruggiero, Gros, & Acierno, 2010) suggest telepsychology is generally as effective as face-to-face (FTF) psychotherapy (Shore et al., 2018) and psychiatry (Hubley, Lynch, Schneck, Thomas, & Shore, 2016). Similarly, evidence-based psychotherapies delivered via telepsychology have generally, though not universally, been found to produce comparable clinical outcomes (Gros et al., 2013). For example, a number of well-designed randomized noninferiority clinical trials have recently been completed in the VA system demonstrating comparable outcomes in telepsychology delivered via VTC and FTF therapy; this includes cognitive processing therapy (CPT) for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD; Morland et al., 2014), prolonged exposure for PTSD (Acierno et al., 2017), and behavioral activation and therapeutic exposure for PTSD (Acierno et al., 2016).However, telepsychology is not without limitations. While telepsychology is employed, in large part, to overcome conventional barriers to care, novel challenges inherent in technology-enhanced treatment present a new set of obstacles. These obstacles require unique ethical and legal considerations beyond those required to perform FTF clinical care; for example, the legal ability to provide services in both the location of the provider and the patient. For good reason, researchers and available resources have largely focused on the legal, regulatory, and ethical considerations pertinent to telepsychology (Glueckauf et al., 2018); for example, a telepsychology provider typically needs to be licensed to provide services both in the state where the provider is and the state where the client is at the time of services (in the military medical system providers need to have clinical privileges in both locations). These constraints are well addressed in other reviews and are beyond the scope of the current paper (Brooks, Turvey, & Augusterfer, 2013; Landry-Poole, Pujol, & Moore, 2017); however, information about the actual clinical practice of telepsychology is lacking.Regarding the logistical and practical delivery of telepsychology services, a survey of telepsychology experts found that adaptations to treatment protocols were recommended for three domains: use of self-report questionnaires, treatment handouts, and in-session examples (Gros et al., 2013). Use of objective standardized outcome tracking measures and self-monitoring logs (e.g., sleep logs) is a part of evidence-based assessment, which is a critical component of evidence-based practice (Beidas et al., 2015; Brewin, 2013). Historically, cognitive-behavioral therapists have been more open to telepsychology than their psychodynamic counterparts (Mora, Nevid, & Chaplin, 2008; Perle et al., 2013); they are also more likely to use treatment manuals in their practice (Becker, Smith, & Jensen-Doss, 2013). Further, a sizable portion of these manualized treatments have worksheets that are core components of the treatment (Shafran et al., 2009). Clinicians attempting to provide these therapies via telepsychology may find themselves confused about how to practically go about providing those services, as distributing and completing worksheets through telepsychology is logistically different than FTF care. The term “in-session examples” refers to the use of visual aids such as a whiteboard or diagram to illustrate a point, facilitate attentional practice, and aid in the evaluation of a treatment target (Beck & Haigh, 2014; Waltman, 2015).Suitable adaptations in the three recommended domains are demonstrated in the following case series in which telepsychology was utilized to deliver evidence-based treatments to an active duty military population. This case series will comprise three manualized therapies that include worksheets as a key component of treatment. A pharmacological treatment case will also be presented. The focus of these cases will be illustrating the adaptations to treatment protocols for the three domains that Gros and colleagues (2013) suggested (i.e., use of self-report questionnaires, treatment handouts, and in-session examples). Some details have been changed or omitted to maintain anonymity without impacting significant aspects of the case presentations. Informed consent was obtained from all individual participants included in the study.The treatment context for these cases is that these were all active duty service members who were treated in military hospitals via telepsychology by clinicians who were located at a different military hospital. Treatment referrals were made from the location where the service members (SMs) were located and cases were managed through the military health system. This model of telepsychology is different from the VA home-based telepsychology model where the client uses telepsychology from their home. In the military model, telepsychology is used to increase access to care and decrease problems related to provider shortages (Landry-Poole et al., 2017). In these settings, the client sits in a telepsychology room in a hospital and connects with a provider in a different hospital using VTC. There is some support staff available to help provide technical support, assist in appointment booking, and coordinate crisis response as needed. This makes the emergency procedures in these settings different than VA or non-VA settings, which will be reviewed below.CPT for PTSD via TelepsychologySergeant Smith (SGT S; pseudoname) was a noncommissioned officer with almost two decades of service, including five tours of combat. His position became emotionally more difficult when advances in technology allowed SGT S to see high-definition video footage of precision artillery strikes. He previously had never seen the carnage resulting from the attacks. He found himself haunted by these images and he would regularly have nightmares of what he saw.The military mental health system uses a web-hosted outcome measure service called Behavioral Health Data Portal (BHDP; Brewin, 2013). Screening and outcome tracking measures were administered via BHDP immediately prior to the telepsychology sessions. A clinical interview was conducted and SGT S met full criteria for a diagnosis of PTSD (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). The PTSD Checklist for DSM–5 (PCL-5; Weathers et al., 2013) was administered and he scored in the clinical range with a score of 66. Though SGT S had been exposed to multiple traumas, he was most distressed by the intrusive memories of those he had killed. A chief component of his PTSD symptoms was a prevailing sense of guilt and shame related to his combat experiences; this persistent sense of iniquity is commonly referred to as moral injury in the literature (Drescher et al., 2011). SGT S was presented with his treatment options and selected CPT (Resick, Monson, & Chard, 2007).CPT is a manualized cognitive-behavioral treatment for PTSD that has been recommended by the updated VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of PTSD (VA & DoD, 2017). A noninferiority trial demonstrated the CPT delivered via telepsychology can produce comparable outcomes to CPT delivered FTF (Morland et al., 2014). The goal of CPT is to foster cognitive modification. This involves coming to terms with what happened and integrating this new learning into the person’s belief set. This is typically accomplished through the use of a series of written thought records.The military version of the CPT manual is available electronically, allowing for worksheets and handouts to be digitally shared with the patient in session via screen-sharing technology. Sharing hard copies of handouts and worksheets with patients via telepsychology can be difficult as it relies on the patient having access to a working printer or the technician printing the handout for the patient (Gros et al., 2013). Worksheets and handouts can be directly sent to the client via encrypted e-mail when that is an option. Some providers also choose to mail a paper copy of worksheets to the client. Typically, before a first session, it is unclear which handouts will be needed with a new patient, and the patient receiving a handout from the technician prior to the session can interrupt the flow of therapy. Also, staffing changes, off-site factors, and responsiveness of the technician can affect the timeliness and availability of technicians to provide worksheets to patients on behalf of the therapist. To account for this, the therapist relied on screen-sharing technology and SGT S’s smart camera phone. The therapist had him take pictures of the computer monitor to capture handouts and the impact statement instructions to facilitate his homework. It is also hoped that taking a picture of the computer monitor will make it harder to lose the information, as people can misplace worksheets, but tend to not lose their smartphones.To aid with psychoeducation and to test his openness toward incorporating smartphone application technology into treatment, SGT S was provided with the VA application PTSD Coach. SGT S used the smartphone app to access high-quality psychoeducation materials, which he used to talk with his family about his PTSD. He responded well to the application, as there was some difficulty getting the paper CPT worksheets to the patient at the remote site. Consequently, he was introduced to an alternate resource in session. CPT Coach (Pospos et al., 2018; Shore et al., 2014) is a smartphone application that can be used as a supplement to psychotherapy with a therapist who is providing CPT. The CPT Coach application contains the worksheets and handouts from the CPT manual in a free smart phone app, which SGT S preferred as an alternative to hand-written worksheets.Within the application, SGT S was able to log his stuck points, view electronic copies of the handouts discussed, and complete thought logs to target his PTSD-related beliefs. In session, Socratic questioning was used to evaluate his stuck points; this involved a series of introspective questions to encourage help him break down his thoughts and come to new conclusions on his own. In lieu of a white board, screen-sharing technology allowed the therapist to share a blank word processor document that could be used to weigh evidence and break down concepts. For example, to address his belief that he was a monster we typed out on the shared screen our jointly derived definition of a monster and then used that to evaluate where he fit the definition. We also created a shared definition of the opposite construct: his being a good person. This definition was saved and whenever new evidence of his being a good person was encountered it was added to the word document in session. This accrual of evidence allowed for an aggregating effect on his stuck points and reduction in self-blame. This, paired with continued use of CPT worksheets housed in the CPT Coach app, allowed for his main stuck point to be addressed and restructured. SGT S’s PTSD symptoms gradually decreased to the subclinical range across eight sessions of CPT, with his initial PCL-5 score of 66 decreasing to a 23. He reported decreases in marital problems and increases in life satisfaction. Based on his improvements, he decided to not retire from military service and he extended his contract with the army. At follow up, his PTSD symptoms were still in the subclinical range.Collaborative Assessment and Management of Suicidality (CAMS) via TelepsychologyGros, Veronee, Strachan, Ruggiero, and Acierno (2011) and Gros et al. (2013) provide excellent descriptions on how to manage risk in home-based telepsychology. Captain C (CPT C; pseudoname) was a 28-year-old soldier with 7 years of service who presented as a medical referral for individual psychotherapy due to depressive symptoms. CPT C reported his persistent suicidal thoughts had recently increased in frequency and intensity in context of a breakup as well as mounting financial concerns and occupational stressors associated with a new position. He had recently begun drafting a suicide note and had purchased a pistol. BHDP (Brewin, 2013) was unavailable at the remote site at the time of the encounter so paper-and-pencil versions of the measures were administered and then scanned and sent via encrypted e-mail to the provider by a psychiatric technician. At intake, his score on the Patient Health Questionnaire (Löwe, Kroenke, Herzog, & Gräfe, 2004) was a 23 (severe depression), baseline Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS; Posner et al., 2011) was a 5 (lifetime thoughts of suicide with plan or actual behavior endorsed), and current C-SSRS was a 4 (past month thoughts of suicide with some intent endorsed). CPT C met criteria for major depressive disorder but the initial focus of clinical attention was suicidal ideation.The majority of the initial session was used to assess risk of harm to self; this was completed through use of the CAMS (Jobes, Moore, & O’Connor, 2007). CAMS is an evidence-based clinical approach for assessing, treating, and tracking suicidal risk. The framework is designed to strengthen the therapeutic alliance and to enhance patient motivation through a highly interactive assessment process that is guided by a tool called the Suicide Status Form (SSF; Jobes, 2006). The SSF uses Likert and qualitative items to assess psychological pain, stress, agitation, hopelessness, self-hate, and overall suicide risk. Traditionally CAMS is performed with the clinician sitting side by side with the patient, and the SSF is handed back and forth between the dyad during the assessment.Prior to beginning the intake session with the patient, the initial SSF was sent from the provider to the technician at the remote site based on the positive suicide screen. Following introductions and consents, CAMS was introduced to the patient. The traditional protocol was discussed as well as the necessary adaptations to conduct the treatment through telepsychology. Specifically, the patient was told a single SSF was meant to be shared and coauthored by the patient and clinician, but would be completed together on two separate copies by each participant during session. As CPT C discussed the constructs and wrote responses on his copy of the form, the clinician wrote the same responses on her copy. In a traditional face-to-face session, this process usually takes 10–15 min. An additional 5–10 min was needed in the telepsychology session to ensure the dyad was accurately recording identical responses.The interim SSF tracking sheets were completed in the same fashion at each encounter. The provider would e-mail the form to the technician at the remote site, and the technician would print the form and provide it to the patient before he entered the treatment room. Information gleaned from the qualitative responses on the SSF was used to inform treatment interventions in subsequent sessions. The treatment plan and crisis response plan were similarly updated as necessary. At the conclusion of each session, CPT C and the provider kept their own copy of the form, and the therapist’s worksheet was uploaded into the soldier’s electronic medical record for documentation purposes.The first several sessions were marked by significant declines in severity ratings on the tracking sheets. After five sessions, CPT C was no longer reporting suicidal thoughts. The subsequent session focused on understanding warning signs for possible future episodes of suicidal ideation and additional coping skills to address inevitable life stressors. During the final session, the final SSF was compared side by side with the initial SSF to serve as a visual aid of the patient’s treatment progress.Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia via TelepsychologySpecialist Martinez (SPC M; pseudoname) was a 29-year-old enlisted service member with 3 years of service who presented with symptoms of anxiety and sleep disturbance after sustaining injuries as a result of a physical assault by her husband. Following the assault, she began psychotherapy with a telepsychology psychotherapy provider and telepsychology prescribing psychologist. Trials of two medications for sleep were unsuccessful due to next-day sedation, so she was referred to a cognitive-behavioral treatment of insomnia (CBT-I) group delivered through telepsychology.CBT-I is an evidence-based treatment that has been shown to be effective for individuals with insomnia. Reviews of the literature show that CBT-I is a standard of care treatment for chronic and severe insomnia (e.g., Morin et al., 1999), with clinical gains that last over the long term. The original protocol described by Perlis, Jungquist, Smith, and Posner (2005) is delivered over eight sessions and contains presentation of the rationale for the treatment, sleep hygiene guidelines (e.g., maintain a regular sleep schedule, avoid alcohol in the evening), diaphragmatic breathing, relaxation strategies, and worry control in later sessions. Sleep diaries are used to calculate sleep efficiency, or the amount of time one is sleeping while in bed, which is ideally in the low 90 percentiles. Importantly, individuals undergoing CBT-I are given a sleep schedule to promote consolidated sleep that initially begins with “prescribing” time in bed to be no more than the average time asleep over 2 weeks according to the sleep diary. Few studies have reported using telehealth for delivery of CBT-I, but one study reported positive results with group CBT-I delivered to veterans (Gehrman, Shah, Miles, Kuna, & Godleski, 2016).Group CBT-ISPC M initially engaged in group CBT-I through telepsychology. She was one of six members of a group that met in a conference room with a large-screen TV. The psychologist facilitator of the 5-week, 1.5-hr/week group originated a video-conferencing call to the conference room where participants sat around a large table. During the first session, SPC M told group members that she slept between 4 and 6 hr, on average, per night and her goal was to sleep 8 hr/night. Screen sharing technology was used to show a brief PowerPoint slides presentation relevant to each group session topic. Group success relied on a behavioral health technician at the receiving site to set up the technology, deliver packets of information used for the group, and be available in case of technology glitch. In subsequent groups, the technician collected sleep diaries from participants, scanned and sent them to the group facilitator via encrypted e-mail at the beginning of each group. An electronic sleep diary embedded in a smart phone application called CBT-I Coach developed by the Veteran’s Administration and the Telemedicine and Advanced Technology Research Center (TATRC) can be used to record daily diaries and transmit the compiled information directly to the provider, but this application could not be used in this instance because of installation security concerns of nonencrypted transmission.The second through fifth groups followed a brief CBT-I protocol. Participants were encouraged to use Breathe to Relax, a smart phone application, also developed by TATRC, to practice diaphragmatic breathing daily. SPC M reported early gains in sleep efficiency during the first 2 weeks in the group that were not maintained during the last two groups. She ended with a sleep efficiency of 80.5% and a total sleep time of 6 hr and requested an individual therapist to continue CBT-I.Individual CBT-IAt intake, SPC M’s anxiety had heightened and she endorsed a suicidal wish to die within the last month, which she indicated was “not a real wish to die,” but a “wish my problems would go away.” She and her primary therapist were working on these problems in weekly psychotherapy, but both agreed she should continue CBT-I. She was also taking hydroxyzine (25 mg) as needed for acute anxiety, but denied using it prior to bedtime. During the intake, screen sharing was used to reinforce how to fill out a sleep diary and to show her a colorful list of sleep hygiene guidelines. She indicated difficulties with nocturnal awakenings when a roommate came in during the night. She described two nightmares/month related to the physical assault and noted functional difficulties during the day. She estimated receiving 6.5 hr of sleep per night with a latency of greater than 60 min and described functional difficulties at work (e.g., falling asleep at work, yawning often, and reduced attention and concentration).Over the course of three follow-up sessions conducted over 6 weeks, SPC M kept her sleep diary consistently and gained skills calculating her own sleep efficiency. She learned to use problem solving to address nocturnal awakenings, some of which she discovered were due to hip pain, which she addressed with her primary care practitioner. With concomitant psychotherapy, her nightmares ceased. Her sleep efficiency grew from 82% to 97% at the end of treatment and she was able to reach her goal of an average of 7.5 hr of sleep/night. Her scores on the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI; Bastien, Vallières, & Morin, 2001; administered via BHDP; Brewin, 2013) decreased from the clinical insomnia range (ISI = 17; moderate severity) at the beginning of the group to a subthreshold range (ISI = 11) over the course of treatment.This example of CBT-I in the group and individual setting illustrates the use of screen sharing technology and of treatment-related phone applications. Because of security and privacy concerns with unencrypted transmission in a military population, the sleep diary in the CBT-I Coach was not used. Transmission of the sleep diary in this setting required a behavioral health technician to send the document through encrypted e-mail. Especially in the group setting when patients may arrive at different times prior to the group (i.e., some close to the start time of the group), there can be interruption from this transmission in group start times while the provider accesses the e-mail and prints the diary at one end and the hard copy is returned to the patient in the group at the other. Another issue with using telepsychology in the group setting, in general, is that real-time interactions are not mimicked as well for the leader. That is, when a person speaks, the static camera does not move to track who is speaking and focus on that person as experienced in a FTF group. Our organization subsequently tested a more sophisticated system with voice and movement tracking that was able to simulate a group more fully. However, this system is not without its downsides in that it took some time for participants to adjust to the camera moving to focus on them when they spoke. SPC M adapted to the telepsychology setting well. This example highlights the successful delivery of CBT-I through telepsychology in both group and individual settings.Pharmacotherapy for PTSD via TelepsychologyFirst Lieutenant Reynolds (1LT R; pseudoname) was a 27-year-old Army infantry officer with less than 2 years of military service who presented for a medication evaluation. He reported symptoms of depression, irritability, and sleep difficulties connected to his combat deployment to Afghanistan. 1LT R’s deployment occurred less than 9 months following his arrival to his first duty station. As an infantry officer, 1LT R led an infantry platoon on over a hundred combat missions in hostile villages across Afghanistan. Exposed to multiple traumatic events during his deployment, within months of returning home, 1LT R manifested many symptoms associated with PTSD to include intrusive thoughts, dysphoric mood, hyperarousal, hypervigilance, and nightmares. His score on the PCL-5 was 63 at intake and he was formally diagnosed with PTSD.Prior to presenting for a medication evaluation, 1LT R had completed a partial course (5 sessions) of prolonged exposure therapy. Although he acknowledged that the therapy was helpful, he found it subjectively too difficult to “constantly talk about what happened” and became frustrated with having to take time off from work every week for treatment. He felt that pharmacotherapy would be a better treatment option for him.1LT R was prescribed sertraline 50 mg daily for his global symptoms of PTSD and prazosin 1 mg each night for his nightmares. Sertraline is a first-line pharmacological intervention for PTSD and is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the disorder. Prazosin is an alpha-adrenergic antagonist that was originally developed to treat hypertension. However, a number of clinical trials have shown it to be effective at reducing nightmares (Aurora et al., 2010; Nappi, Drummond, & Hall, 2012), although recent concerns have been raised regarding its efficacy (Raskind et al., 2018). Prazosin is not FDA approved for nightmares or PTSD. During the maintenance phase of treatment, 1LT R reached a dose of 150 mg of sertraline and 5 mg of prazosin. He also took over-the-counter melatonin on an as-needed basis.In addition to dealing with PTSD, 1LT R was also suffering from back and neck pain and migraines related to an injury he sustained during his deployment. Consequently, he was prescribed a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory (back and neck) and a triptan (migraines) by his primary care manager. Prior to prescribing medication for his PTSD, a discussion about the potential risks associated with drug-drug interactions occurred. 1LT R and the prescribing psychologist discussed the increased risk of internal bleeding and serotonin toxicity related to his medication regimen (common risks associated with serotonergic antidepressants and medications regularly used for pain management). During the discussion, the drug interaction program Lexicomp was used and the results were shared with the patient virtually. Lexicomp is an online tool that provides important information about potential interactions between medications and offers suggestions to prevent interactions from occurring. Similar programs are available at no cost to the user. As noted in the first case study, telepsychology providers have the capacity to share their computer screen images with their patients. Sharing the details of potential drug-drug interactions visually with the patient resulted in a more thorough and thoughtful discussion regarding potential interactions compared to a typical one-sided psychoeducational exchange. 1LT R stated, “I appreciate you reviewing these potential interactions in detail. If I had not seen them I probably would have forgotten what you said.” In this provider’s experience (author BAM), similar feedback from other patients is common. Discussions about potential drug-drug interactions is important in psychopharmacological practice, however, the level of retention and understanding of this material by patients is oftentimes uncertain. Seeing this key information “on screen” during the discussion appears to increase understanding and retention.In addition to psychoeducation regarding potential drug-drug interactions, through the same screen-sharing process used for the drug information session, data were shared virtually with 1LT R regarding his progress. The BHDP tracks serial assessments of a variety of instruments to include the PCL-5. Each session 1LT R was able to see his current PCL-5 score and compare it to past scores. Over the course of 9 months he had 12 unique PCL-5 scores, which trended downward with the highest score being at the time of evaluation (63) and his lowest score being at Session 12 (28). Session 12 was the last session of the maintenance phase of treatment. 1LT Reynolds found the ability to track the trajectory of his scores to be highly reinforcing. At one point he stated:When I can see my scores on the screen and watch how the scores go down over time, it becomes like a game for me. It makes me want to see how far I can go . . . how low I can get my scores . . . how quickly I can get better.Research has shown that routine use of outcome measures, and the sharing of the results of those outcome measures, increases patient treatment adherence and improves outcomes (Lambert, 2013). Handouts were not used with this patient.DiscussionAn advantage of telepsychology is the increased ability to provide services to patients in low resourced environments (Landry-Poole et al., 2017). This can also decrease the time costs of attending treatment as the individuals treated in this study did not have to venture away from work to receive care. Further, telepsychology allowed for people in need of research-supported treatment interventions to receive quality treatments from providers who were several hours away. Consistent with previous research findings, delivering manualized treatments via telepsychology can be just as effective as FTF care (Shore et al., 2018); however, as noted in the introduction, adaptations to VTC are needed. The above cases illustrate the commonly used adaptations well (Table 1).TABLES AND FIGUREStable/figure thumbnailTable 1. Observed Adaptations to TelepsychologyView larger image > in this page > in new window> Download slideSelf-Report QuestionnairesThe use of self-report questionnaires (e.g., objective standardized outcome tracking measures and self-monitoring logs) is a part of evidence-based assessment, which is a critical component of evidence-based practice (Beidas et al., 2015; Brewin, 2013). Administering self-report questionnaires from a distance via telepsychology is different than being FTF, but there are several workable solutions.As illustrated in the CBT-I case example, measures like sleep logs can be filled out on paper forms and then scanned and transmitted through encrypted messenger or emails. This process requires planning ahead and is not feasible for every provider or setting. Some of the smartphone applications discussed above have embedded self-report questionnaires and tracking measures, but there are questions about transmitting the data from the applications to the therapist in a secure manner. As an alternative option, a patient could use the measure in the application and read the clinician a summary. For example, the sleep log in the CBT-I coach will calculate an overall sleep efficiency quotient. A patient could describe his week and then verbally provide the summary figures from the applications. That sleep efficiency figure can then be used to inform that week’s sleep schedule recommendations.Alternatively, patients may take the standardized measures online through secure web-based assessment surveys, such as BHDP described above. A number of web-based practice management programs allow for the secure transmission and collection of standardized measures and questionnaires but require foreplanning and coordination. Of course, HIPAA concerns would necessitate a business associate agreement and reputable companies will easily be able to provide these to consumers. The above cases benefitted from having a paraprofessional psychiatric technician on site with the patients to help facilitate the BHDP process. If this process was conducted without a technician’s help, clientele would need to be trained to complete the web-based surveys, which might be more difficult for some patients than others. There are alternative procedures that can be used.When having the patient complete the web-based survey prior to the session is not feasible, the measure may be verbally administered during the session. This will take up some of the session time and may force a clinician to be more judicious about which outcome-tracking measures are utilized. Additionally, there are considerations about whether verbal administration of a measure affects item response, or if this method of administration is in keeping with measure standardization procedures. Future research may look at this topic to inform clinical practice. A list of free and psychometrically sound outcome measures can be found in a previous review (Beidas et al., 2015). As illustrated in the final case example, incorporating outcome tracking into the active components of treatment can enhance clinical outcomes, this being consistent with previous findings (Lambert, 2013).Treatment HandoutsTreatment handouts and worksheets are a common component of manualized treatments (Shafran et al., 2009). Treatment handouts can be transmitted electronically, printed, filled out by hand, scanned, and sent back electronically. An additional option is that a treatment packet or patient manual can be mailed to the client or facility where the client is being seen to facilitate treatment—this strategy does require extra effort but it is a reliable method. A key take away is that using handouts in telepsychology requires forethought and planning—it is harder to be spontaneous with forms being used in telepsychology. In some cases, digital copies can be used; however, they are not always available and copyrights may limit a clinician’s ability to create a digital copy of an extant form from a treatment manual.Conceptually, there is a difference between handouts and worksheets. Handouts are informational and easier to use with screen-sharing technology or when using secure e-mail. In the above cases, the providers used screen sharing to share a number of different figures, but this is different from having a handout someone can physically take away with them. A low cost solution is to have the patient take a picture of the screen to capture the information. Software-based solutions such as screen shots might also be workable solutions, depending on whether or not it is a shared device. Additionally, a photograph of a shared screen or a screen shot could be printed for later use.Many of the newer smart phone applications (e.g., CPT Coach and CBT-I Coach) described above have the treatment handouts embedded in the application. Notably, these mobile health apps were developed by the VA or Defense Health Agency, and so they are secure and free to use. The user’s data is stored on their own device and many of these apps allow for personal identification number locking of the apps data. In these cases, one can reference the application and go over it together with the information already contained in their phones. The CPT Coach app also has an embedded ABC worksheet function that can be used as a thought record if verbally reviewed together. The patient described in the first case preferred this over the paper ABC worksheets as he was less worried about losing it or leaving it out where someone else might read it.Some manualized treatments specify how the handouts are to be used. This requires careful accommodation when utilizing telepsychology. For example, in CAMS the dyad is supposed to collaboratively fill out the forms together. This can be difficult from a distance but the above case illustrates how planning can allow for the therapist and patient to each have their own copy of requisite forms that they complete together.In-Session ExamplesUse of in-session examples can help increase the attentional focus on the information being discussed and the intervention being used (Beck & Haigh, 2014). This is most often completed through use of screen-sharing technology that is a core function in most telepsychology VTC software. When digital copies of forms are illustrations or figures are available, they can be shared via screen sharing. When the provider needs to create something novel, a blank word processor document can be used as a white board to track or list out the items that might normally be written out in session. In the CPT example, the therapist used this white board function to list out a shared definition of what it meant to be a monster and what it meant to be a good person. Other common software applications can be used as a white board with screen sharing. For example, the common paint applications (e.g., Microsoft Paint, Corel Painter, Krita, MyPaint; SketchBook) can be used to sketch out a concept like a habituation curve. Additionally, screen sharing an Internet search engine can allow for some new in-session example options as the clinician and patient directly research topics together. For example, if a patient is exceedingly hopeless, thinking they cannot go on after a major setback, a provider could look up stories about people who had similar setbacks and went on to have meaningful and happy lives. Providers might choose to address web browser settings so that previous search terms do not autopopulate the search field.Other ConsiderationsThere may need to be additional modifications and considerations for group therapies. In the CBT-I case example, the group facilitator noted a limitation with the technology. A static camera did not focus on the person who was speaking and a camera that focused in on motion had a lag time. Alterations in the pacing and practice of delivering group evidence-based treatments via telepsychology are likely required. Further research and innovation on the topic are needed.Additional considerations include patient access to a working printer and scanner. This might not be a static variable and having a backup plan for when technology fails is a requirement in telepsychology care (Landry-Poole et al., 2017). The key is to be flexible and think ahead wherever possible.The setting where the telepsychology occurs is another consideration; some of the strategies discussed above may need to be modified to suit the needs and resources of different treatment systems of care. Active duty military hospitals have different procedures, than VA home-based telepsychology. VA homebased providers have safety procedures that start before the first session where there is an initial thorough safety screen regarding the suitability and safety of the homebased setting and the risk and protective factors of the clients being served to ensure that telepsychology is an appropriate option. Risk management continues in on ongoing manner, where at the start of the session they verify the physical location of the client so they know where to dispatch emergency services if needed, they verify the callback phone number in case they get disconnected, and they verify the phone number of the emergency contact. In military hospitals, the client is already in a hospital and on-site support staff can physically assist in an emergency.Both of these procedures can be different from what a psychologist in independent practice might do, and other health systems might have other resources and limitations. Psychologists in independent practice will need to attend to practical and legal matters that we have not elaborated on: these include licensing requirements, HIPAA considerations, and practical considerations related to elements like screen sharing. Brooks and colleagues (2013) have a good review of how to overcome some of the common barriers that exist. Also, the scientific principle or using a pilot study or test run to find and work out potential barriers can be useful. We have attempted to draw out and demonstrate a variety of ideas and principles such that some, but not all, of this might be applicable depending on the setting and available resources. Further innovation is likely to be needed, as creativity and pragmatism is a hallmark of telepsychology. Clinicians in various settings are encouraged to follow the recommendations of Gros et al. (2013) and to make careful adaptations to the following domains use of self-report questionnaires, treatment handouts, and in-session examples, to ensure high quality care is being delivered.Summary and Future DirectionsEvidence-based psychotherapies and pharmacological therapies can be delivered effectively through telepsychology; this is well established in the literature. A recent survey of telepsychology experts demonstrated the need for guidance on how to adapt these practices for telepsychology with a specific focus on three domains: use of self-report questionnaires, treatment handouts, and in-session examples (Gros et al., 2013). The case series above demonstrated feasible workable solutions to address these domains of treatment. Further research and innovation on the topic is needed. Treatment developers may wish to provide guidance on the topic; additionally, they may choose to make available digital materials that can be used in telepsychology to facilitate the intended treatment effects. Research funders may choose to offer grant funding to study and develop adaptations to existing treatment protocols for telepsychology. These cases demonstrate the value of high quality smart phone applications (e.g., PTSD Coach, CPT Coach, PE Coach, CBT-I Coach; Pospos et al., 2018; Shore et al., 2014) that can be used in conjunction with telepsychology to help address the three different domains. Further research on how to best use these applications is needed and development of additional applications will also likely be needed. Journal editors may seek to solicit and publish more practice-focused literature on the topic of adapting evidence-based care to telepsychology settings to further clarify this process for front-line telepsychology clinicians. Graduate-level and postgraduate-level training programs may choose to include supervised training in these adaptations as telepsychology is a growing field of practice.Statement of Human RightsAll procedures performed in studies involving human participants were in accordance with the ethical standards of the institutional and/or national research committee (include name of committee + reference number) and with the 1964 Helsinki declaration and its later amendments or comparable ethical standards. Child-onset disruptive behavior disorders (DBDs) are characterized by oppositional and defiant behaviors, impulsivity, and aggression (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). Young children with behavioral challenges incur considerable costs to society (Moffitt, Caspi, Harrington, & Milne, 2002; Rivenbark et al., 2018). These children are at high risk for continued conduct problems and antisocial problems well into adolescence and adulthood (Babinski, Hartsough, & Lambert, 1999; Lee & Hinshaw, 2004; Mordre, Groholt, Kjelsberg, Sandstad, & Myhre, 2011; Sibley et al., 2011). Recently, Galán, Wang, Shaw, and Forbes (2019) conducted a follow-up study of young children through adolescence and adulthood and found that early onset behavioral challenges were predictive of violent behavior in adolescence and adulthood, adolescent correlates of antisocial behavior, and internalizing problems in adulthood. This study further found that those children with chronic, early problems were at highest risk for multiple types of difficulties during adolescence and adulthood including violent behavior, depression, and anxiety symptoms. Similarly, Rivenbark et al. (2018) found that although young children with early onset and chronic behavioral problems account for only 9% of the population, they account for approximately 53% of criminal convictions, 16% of emergency department visits, and 20% of medical prescriptions in adulthood. These data point to the early childhood period as an important window of opportunity to intervene in the lives of young children with behavioral problems.Behavioral parent training (BPT) is the most well-studied and efficacious psychosocial intervention for school-age children with DBDs (Chacko et al., 2017). This intervention is based on social interaction theory, which suggests that parents and children engage in a coercive cycle in which both escalate their aversive behavior until one party gives in, which reinforces child noncompliance as well as ineffective parenting techniques (Granic & Patterson, 2006; Patterson, 1982). In BPT, parents and caregivers are taught to lessen the intensity of this coercive cycle by using reinforcement and limit setting skills to simultaneously reduce misbehavior while increasing incompatible “positive-opposite” behavior. Core skills taught include praise, play, direct commands, and time-out (Chorpita & Daleiden, 2009). Implementation of BPT as a first-line intervention is critical in order to improve the lives of youth with DBDs and reduce familial and societal burden (Kaminski & Claussen, 2017).Graduate programs increased emphasis on evidence-based interventions (EBIs) and state requirements for, and availability of, continuing education courses have led to increased opportunities for training in EBIs. However, data suggest that graduate school training in EBIs for childhood psychiatric disorders is relatively rare when compared with adult-focused EBIs (Pidano & Whitcomb, 2012). Moreover, although individual training elements (i.e., didactics, ongoing consultation, and feedback) are often utilized in graduate training, their combination, which is considered best practices (Edmunds, Beidas, & Kendall, 2013; Herschell, Kolko, Baumann, & Davis, 2010), is less common. Continuing education courses typically focus on didactics and immediate hands-on practice (role-plays) but are rarely individualized and ongoing consultation is not often provided. However, having consultants physically available for training and ongoing consultation is not typically feasible, due in large part to funding and time constraints (Fixsen, Blase, Duda, Naoom, & Van Dyke, 2010).New technologies provide opportunities to increase the accessibility of high-quality training (Barnett, 2011; Kazdin & Blase, 2011). In particular, online clinician training offers several advantages to traditional methods, including 24-hr access, customization (e.g., self-paced, allowing for repetition and review), opportunity for interactive exercises, and multimedia training components (audio, video, animation, etc.), all of which have been shown to enhance knowledge retention (Khanna & Kendall, 2015; Zhang, 2005). Research has found that using interactive, web-based tutorials combined with live remote coaching can significantly improve therapeutic skills (Kobak, Opler, & Engelhardt, 2007) and knowledge (Brennan, Sellmaier, Jivanjee, & Grover, 2018).The purpose of the present pilot study was to develop and test a technological platform for training mental health professionals in BPT. This training is innovative in that it paired an online tutorial on BPT’s theoretical principles and four core skills (i.e., praise, play, commands, and time-out) with live remote coaching and role-plays with a trainer in order to maximize participant knowledge and skill acquisition. This project is significant because there is a general dearth of research on the efficacy of online training of psychological interventions, and in particular, despite their increasing usage, little data exist on the efficacy of hybrid training models. Finally, and perhaps most important, no web-based therapist training course that combines these two components and focuses specifically on BPT for DBDs has been tested. The aspects of individualization of the training, immediate tailored feedback, and ongoing consultation are essential to the training intervention that we have developed and offers a distinct opportunity for both students and clinicians. Pilot studies, such as this one, are crucial first steps toward evaluating whether these training models can lead to markedly higher penetration rates of evidence-based practice.The aims of the study were to evaluate whether the web platform operated successfully, participants found the content satisfactory, and participants’ knowledge of BPT principles and skill improved. Finding preliminary evidence that our training is feasible and acceptable would serve as a first step toward increasing dissemination of BPT training to mental health professionals, thereby increasing treatment availability for parents of children with disruptive behaviors. Initial findings suggesting that we can improve clinicians’ ability to conduct BPT would also lend support for conducting a larger trial to determine whether clinicians who received the training could demonstrate improved outcomes in their clients’ parenting skills as well as improvements in their clients’ children’s disruptive behaviors.MethodParticipantsAs shown in Table 1,TABLES AND FIGUREStable/figure thumbnailTable 1. Demographic CharacteristicsView larger image > in this page > in new window> Download slidethe 26 participants who enrolled and provided consent were primarily female (n = 19; 73.1%), White (n = 21; 80.8%), and, on average, 29.7 years of age (SD = 7.3 years). Half had a bachelor’s degree (n = 13), seven (26.9%) had a doctoral-level degree, and six (23.1%) had a master’s degree. The sample had, on average, 4.15 years (SD = 5.82) of clinical experience, and 16 participants (61.5%) were enrolled in graduate school at the time of the study. The majority of the sample (n = 20; 76.9%) had no prior formal training in BPT.ProcedureInstitutional review board approval was obtained for this study and recruitment occurred between January 30, 2018, and June 28, 2018. Potential participants were recruited through professional listservs and by e-mail announcements to clinical psychology doctoral students at Long Island University Post and New York University. Interested individuals contacted a designated member of the investigative team who determined eligibility and secured informed consent via electronic signature. Eligibility criteria included adults who were practicing clinicians or graduate students in psychology or social work.Thirty-one people expressed interest in participating in this pretest–posttest open trial and signed consent forms allowing us to send them links to pretraining assessments. Of that number, 26 people completed pretest assessment materials and began the online tutorial. Twenty-two participants completed the online tutorial and 21 subsequently met with a BPT trainer for three video conference coaching sessions (one participant who completed the online tutorial did not complete the coaching sessions or the posttest).Pre- and posttraining assessment of didactic knowledge and clinical skillsAs shown in Figure 1,TABLES AND FIGUREStable/figure thumbnailFigure 1. Participant Procedure.View larger image > in this page > in new window> Download slideonce enrolled, but before accessing the online materials, participants completed the Didactic Knowledge Questionnaire on their knowledge of BPT concepts and principles. We also assessed their clinical skills in conducting BPT with a mock caregiver, who was a member of the research team. Because trainees were located in diverse areas of the country, a web-based interface (Zoom) was used to conduct and record the pre- and posttest of trainee clinical skills. During these video-recorded role-plays, participants were asked to describe the theory underlying four BPT skills (nondirective play, praise, time-out, and commands), teach the components of each skill to the mock caregiver, and role-play administering the skills as if the participant was the caregiver of a child with a DBD (the trainer played a mock child). Each pretest (and subsequent posttest) assessment video of clinical skill was edited by a single member of the research team to remove all evidence of whether it occurred before or after the training. For example, if a research participant remarked that it was nice to see the research team member again, that segment of the video was deleted. Videos were then randomly assigned to the other research team members, who were blind to pretest or posttest recording status. Each video was scored by a single research team member with the BPT skills checklist and the adapted Fidelity of Implementation Rating System (FIMP) continuous rating (descriptions in measures section). Before videos were scored, team members had practiced on mock video segments. Given the structure of the FIMP and the BPT skills checklist, research team members quickly converged on a high level of interrater reliability (all research team members obtained Cohen’s kappas and intraclass correlation coefficients of >.8 for BPT skills checklists and FIMP ratings, respectively) before scoring videos used for data analysis.After completion of the pretest assessment of knowledge and the role-play, participants were sent a link to access the online tutorial. After completion of the online tutorial, participants completed the System Usability Scale (SUS) and User Satisfaction Questionnaire (USQ; descriptions in measures section) and once again completed the Didactic Knowledge Questionnaire. They then engaged in three live video conference practice coaching sessions (described in the next section) with a BPT trainer who was the same individual who served as the mock caregiver in the pretest. Once the live coaching sessions were completed, the participant completed a posttest role-play assessment identical to the pretest assessment with the same BPT trainer, who again served as a mock caregiver. Participants also completed the Evaluation of Applied Training Scale (EATS; description in measures section) measure of satisfaction with the live training.Online didactic tutorialThe online tutorial contained 10 modules covering the theoretical principles underlying BPT, key features on each of the four skills covered (labeled praise, positive play, commands, and time-out) and how to effectively teach these skills to caregivers (see Appendix A of the online supplemental materials for a complete description of course content and learning objectives). We determined which BPT skills to include in the online tutorial by reviewing efficacious BPT manuals for parents of young children and selecting skills commonly practiced across these interventions. Second, we compared our list with a study that used a distilling and matching model to determine common practice elements across randomized child treatment trials, including those focused on child behavior problems (Chorpita & Daleiden, 2009). In line with BPT manuals, praise was defined as rewarding a child with verbal and nonverbal approval as a method of reinforcing target behaviors. Participants learned the rationale for emphasizing praise over punishment as well as strategies for effectively praising children (e.g., praising immediately after a target behavior). Play focused on a set of strategies (e.g., reflecting a child’s words, avoiding commands and questions) for shifting caregiver attention from unwanted behaviors to those they wished to increase as well as improving the quality of caregiver–child interactions. Participants were also taught how to help parents effectively structure playtimes and ignore undesired behaviors. Commands were defined as prompts designed to elicit child compliance, followed by contingent reinforcement. Finally, a time-out from reinforcement was taught as a more effective punishment procedure than corporal punishment strategies. Participants learned how to identify target behaviors for time-out, the sequence of steps to follow to carry out the procedure effectively, and how to handle child noncompliance during time-out.Studies have found that high levels of interactivity, multimodel learning, and ongoing self-tests enhance knowledge retention in online training (Brennan et al., 2018). Thus, the tutorial contains interactive exercises, animated graphics, ongoing interactive self-tests, and video examples of techniques in a multimodal, multimedia, interactive learning approach (visit http://telepsychology.net/BPT_Default.aspx to access the online tutorial).Live remote coachingBecause didactic training alone is insufficient for acquiring new clinical skills, providing an opportunity for trainees to practice applying these skills was a critical component of the training (Washburn et al., 2019). The primary goal of the 60-min coaching sessions was to reinforce knowledge learned in the tutorial and provide opportunities to model and role-play the use of the skills. To do this, the trainer pretended to be a parent seeking help with a disruptive child and the research subject acted as the therapist. Session 1 focused on praise and play, Session 2 focused on commands and time-out, and Session 3 was flexible, allowing each trainer and participant pair to determine what content was most important to discuss and practice. In Sessions 1 and 2, trainers asked whether the participants had questions about the skill and then asked how the participant thought the skill fit within an operant-conditioning/social-learning model and helped to clarify their understanding. Participants were encouraged to discuss how the skill fit with other previously discussed skills (e.g., how does time-out fit with praise within an operant-conditioning/social-learning model?). Next, trainers focused on three components: the rationale for each skill, how to teach caregivers each skill, and how to role-play each skill with caregivers. Participants were taught the rationale for each skill in order to learn how to explain the purpose of the skill to caregivers, which would likely increase buy in. They then learned how to teach caregivers didactics on specific components of each skill to ensure they could thoroughly describe each step of the skill to clients. Finally, they learned how to role-play to provide caregivers with the opportunity to see each skill modeled before rehearsing it themselves. For example, in this final part, trainers pretended to be a disruptive child and research participants were taught to put the child (trainer) into time-out. In Session 3, trainers answered any remaining questions and asked participants to describe the rationale of all of the skills in an integrated way. The bulk of the session was then spent modeling and role-playing the nuances of skills. Skills were typically practiced with some increased challenges (e.g., time-out with a child refusing to go to time-out).MeasuresUser Satisfaction QuestionnaireSatisfaction with the web-based tutorial’s clinical content was evaluated using the USQ (Kobak, Reynolds, & Greist, 1994). The USQ is a self-report measure that contains eight statements pertaining to whether participants found the training to be interesting, easy to understand, enjoyable, useful/relevant, and satisfactory. Users rated their satisfaction on a 4-point scale (strongly agree, agree, disagree, strongly disagree). The scale ranges from 8 to 32 and has good internal consistency (Kobak, Lipsitz, Markowitz, & Bleiberg, 2017).System Usability ScaleSatisfaction with the technical aspects of the web-based tutorial was assessed with the 10-item SUS (Bangor, Kortum, & Miller, 2008; Brooke, 1996). The SUS is a reliable, well-validated measure designed to evaluate usability and user satisfaction with web-based applications and other technologies. On a 0 to 100 scale, a SUS score greater than 50.9 (mean rating for systems considered “okay”) is considered evidence of system user friendliness (Bangor, Kortum, & Miller, 2009; see Appendix B of the online supplemental materials for a copy of the SUS).Evaluation of user satisfaction with applied trainingThe EATS was used to evaluate satisfaction with the live coaching. It assessed trainees’ perspectives on how much they learned from the live training, their self-assessed competence on the various skills covered, and their level of satisfaction with live training components. The EATS has been used previously in studies of live online training (e.g., Kobak, Wolitzky-Taylor, Craske, & Rose, 2017; see Appendix C of the online supplemental materials for a copy of the EATS).Didactic knowledge questionnaireTo assess changes in participants’ knowledge of BPT concepts and principles (causes of noncompliance, operant conditioning, praise, play, commands, time-out), participants completed a 54-item, multiple-choice questionnaire created by the investigators before and after completing the online tutorial. Each item tests participants’ understanding of key critical concepts covered in the tutorial.BPT skill checklistTo assess change in skill at delivering BPT content, 13 videos were taken of each participant role-playing with trainers, both before they accessed the online tutorial and again after they had completed both the online tutorial and live coaching. Three videos were recorded for each of the four parenting skills (explaining the rationale for the skill to a parent, teaching a parent the steps involved in implementing the skill, demonstrating how to role-play the skill with a parent). The time-out skill included a fourth video on how to role-play handling noncompliance with time-out. Trainees’ pre- and posttraining videos were blindly evaluated using the BPT Skills Checklist (see Appendix D of the online supplemental materials for a copy of the checklist), which assessed the key points they were expected to address in each of the role-plays for each skill. Play included the largest number of key points (n = 29), followed by time-out (n = 27), praise (n = 24), and commands (n = 14).Adapted Fidelity of Implementation Rating SystemParticipants’ pre- and posttraining videos were also blindly rated using an abbreviated form of the FIMP (Knutson, Forgatch, Rains, & Sigmarsdóttir, 2009). The FIMP is a coding system that was created to measure therapists’ adherence to the Oregon model of parent management training (Forgatch, 1994) along five dimensions: Knowledge, Structure, Teaching, Process Skills, and Overall Development. Scores on the FIMP have been found to predict parent-training outcomes, such as improvement in children’s disruptive behavior (Thijssen, Albrecht, Muris, & de Ruiter, 2017). The FIMP is typically used to evaluate sections of BPT sessions that span 10 min or more. Given that the segments that were rated in the present study were much shorter (often 2 min or less) and were role-plays of specific skills, some of the items on the FIMP did not apply. For example, the original FIMP assesses how well practitioners explain homework assignments to clients, which did not apply in our case. We primarily used the knowledge and teaching subscales of the FIMP. Investigators rated each of the 13 pretraining and posttraining role-plays on a 9-point Likert scale. As on the original FIMP, scores between 1 and 3 were categorized as “needs work,” scores between 4 and 6 were categorized as “acceptable,” and scores between 7 and 9 were categorized as “good work.” The mean scores for each parenting skill were computed by adding the three FIMP ratings (rationale, teaching, and role-play) and dividing by three.ResultsSatisfactionSatisfaction with the clinical components of the online tutorial was assessed with the USQ. As shown in Table 2,TABLES AND FIGUREStable/figure thumbnailTable 2. User Satisfaction Questionnaire Mean Satisfaction Ratings of Online TutorialView larger image > in this page > in new window> Download slideon a scale from 1 to 4, with 1 signifying strongly disagree and 4 signifying strongly agree, overall, participants were satisfied with the online tutorial (M = 3.46, SD = .67) and would recommend it to others (M = 3.5, SD = .67). Participants found the online content interesting (M = 3.36, SD = .73), easy to understand (M = 3.73, SD = .46), enjoyable (M = 3.5, SD = .67), and useful/relevant in teaching them to help parents with noncompliant children (M = 3.68, SD = .48). Although still high, participants were less enthusiastic about their ability to apply these skills to clients (M = 3.23, SD = .43). This was expected, as the rating was made prior to live coaching and was one of the reasons for adding live coaching to the online content. Relating to the technical components of the online tutorial, participants rated the “system usability” score for the online tutorial as 86.7, which is between “excellent” and “best imaginable.”With respect to the live coaching, scores on the EATS indicated that overall satisfaction was high (M = 3.81, SD = .40). Trainees reported that the live coaching enhanced their professional expertise (M = 3.81, SD = .40) and facilitated answering their questions (M = 3.95, SD = 2.2). This rating was also on a scale from 1 to 4, with 1 signifying strongly disagree and 4 signifying strongly agree. Similarly, as shown in Table 3,TABLES AND FIGUREStable/figure thumbnailTable 3. Mean Ratings of Self-Assessed Competency on Behavioral Parent Training Skills Pre- and Posttraining (N = 21)View larger image > in this page > in new window> Download slidetrainees’ self-ratings of competence in using the four core BPT skills were low before training, ranging from 2.2 to 2.8 (on a scale from 1 = very little to 5 = a great deal), and high after training, ranging from 4.3 to 4.6. All four mean ratings were significantly higher at posttest than at pretest, with very large effect sizes.KnowledgeMean scores on the Didactic Knowledge Questionnaire evaluating trainee knowledge of the theory and practice of BPT at posttest (M = 40.36, SD = 4.93) were significantly higher than at pretest (M = 21.82, SD = 4.03; t = 18.24, p < .001). The effect size of the difference was very large (Cohen’s d = 3.889). As shown in Table 4,TABLES AND FIGUREStable/figure thumbnailTable 4. Mean Self-Ratings on the Evaluation of Applied Training ScaleView larger image > in this page > in new window> Download slideafter completing both training components, applicants rated their knowledge of the rationale for each of the four parenting skills and the practical steps for teaching each skill as very high, with mean scores for each rating reaching almost the top score of 5, which corresponded to “a great deal.”SkillUsing the BPT checklist, we rated participants’ skills on a series of structured role-plays at pretest and after participants had finished both online tutorial and remote coaching. Before training, out of 96 possible points, the average participant demonstrated 27.4 skills (SD = 14.2), and after training, the average score was 59.6 skills (SD = 12.6). The difference in means was statistically significant (t = 9.4, p < .001, Cohen’s d = 2.4). As shown in Table 5,TABLES AND FIGUREStable/figure thumbnailTable 5.

Similarly, as shown in Table 6,TABLES AND FIGUREStable/figure thumbnailTable 6. Mean Adapted Fidelity of Implementation Rating System (FIMP) Scale Scores, Pre- and Posttraining (N = 21)View larger image > in this page > in new window> Download slideblind continuous ratings of skill, using the adapted FIMP scale, revealed statistically significant improvements on observed skill in using all four BPT domains (all ps <.001), with very large effect sizes.Duration of TrainingThe mean number of days taken to complete the online tutorial was 27.04 (SD = 19.25, range = 2–66). The mean total duration of training (online tutorial plus remote coaching) was 69.57 days (SD = 23.70, range = 34–117).DiscussionThe purpose of this study was to develop a multicomponent, technology-based platform with the potential to train large numbers of mental health professionals in BPT. Findings suggest that the training platform increased trainees’ knowledge of BPT concepts and principles as well as improved BPT skills. Moreover, trainees reported high levels satisfaction with the online tutorial content as well as with the live remote coaching. Overall, the findings of this preliminary study are encouraging and indicate high potential for the BPT technology training platform to meet a significant limitation in the field, namely, limited access to engaging, efficient, and effective approaches to training mental health providers in BPT. The training platform initially provided an online tutorial, which allowed for self-paced acquisition of material, interactive self-tests with feedback, and video case vignettes of skill implementation. Following the online tutorial, trainees were provided live, remote coaching via videoconference. The coaching provided the essential opportunity to learn how to use the BPT skills through modeling and role-playing with feedback—essential to skill acquisition (Herschell et al., 2010). Evaluation of skill competencies is a critically overlooked aspect of continuing education programs. Use of web-based technologies can help facilitate this important aspect of training. Some have even suggested a competency-based system for awarding CE credits (Washburn et al., 2019).Results of the study demonstrated that following the training, participants self-reported high levels of understanding and competence in the concepts, principles, and techniques of BPT. It is important to note that trainees had low levels of self-reported competence at pretraining, with a relatively large standard deviation. It is likely that the large effects are driven by those trainees with initial low levels of initial competence. Importantly, self-reported increases in competence were paralleled by data demonstrating increases in observed skills. Specifically, on average, the number of steps of a BPT skill that was implemented correctly nearly doubled in all areas following training (see Table 5). Similarly, observed ratings of the quality of each skill implemented increased considerably from pretraining to posttraining (see Table 6). These observations of improved quantity and quality of BPT skills implemented suggested that this brief technology-based platform changes behavior in substantial ways—effect size data for the observed rating were large across all outcomes.Acceptability of a training approach is an important outcome, particularly when the training approach is to be disseminated to an audience with varying backgrounds (e.g., student trainees vs. licensed mental health providers; those with varying comfort with technology). As such, developing a user-friendly and highly acceptable training platform was a key goal of this study. Results of the study demonstrated that participants strongly agreed that the online tutorial was presented in a useful, relevant, and easy-to-understand manner. Moreover, participants rated that they were able to apply the skills and, overall, were satisfied with the tutorial. The data strongly suggest that this platform serves as a strong foundation for learning BPT specifically and CBT approaches more generally.The study had limitations that provide important context to better understand the findings and also point to future directions in this line of research and clinical training. First, this pilot study was an open trial with no control group or randomization to condition. This structure limits conclusions about causality, as it does not control for external threats to validity, such as regression to the mean, maturation, or history (Sapp, 2017). Another limitation is that study participants did not adequately represent the full range of mental health practitioners in the field. As an example, social work professionals are centrally involved in the delivery of interventions for children and families; however, only one participant in this study had a social work background. Moreover, the modal primary theoretical orientation of study participants was behavioral/cognitive–behavioral—individuals who are likely motivated to acquire further training on interventions, as this one did, that align with their particular orientation. The sample was also homogenous with respect to gender, ethnicity, and years of experience, potentially limiting the generalizability of findings to men, people of color, and more experienced clinicians. The online training was designed to cover fundamentals of social learning theory and BPT, which may be less useful for more advanced clinicians. However, the live supervision was conducted at the level of the trainee’s skill and often focused on advanced topics, such as implementation and flexibility for particular presentations.Beyond the representativeness of the sample, there were additional limitations. Most of the measures we used to assess outcomes were either adapted from other measures (e.g., the FIMP) or created by us. Although they have high face validity, measures with documented strong psychometric properties would inspire more confidence in the results. In addition, we did not assess BPT skills in the context of naturalistic therapy sessions with a parent. As such, our data are proxies for skills implementation and fidelity. Lastly, we did not assess longer term maintenance of BPT skills. Given that there is often a decrement in skills over time (Schoenwald, Garland, Southam-Gerow, Chorpita, & Chapman, 2011), the extent to which changes following training are maintained remains an unexplored issue.Despite the limitations of the study, the findings point to important clinical implications and future directions. First, findings suggest that the technology platform offers a user-friendly and effective approach to training both students and professionals in key, but limited, aspects of BPT. Importantly, relative to traditional, oft-used face-to-face training, the technology-focused training platform is efficient, while remaining effective in teaching concepts and skills. To our knowledge, there are no other technology-based training approaches to BPT—a surprising state of affairs given the common presentation of disruptive behavioral problems in clinic settings and the prominence of BPT as a first-line treatment approach. Given our findings, a fully developed, technology-based training platform offers an opportunity to bridge the research-to-practice gap through significantly increasing the availability of BPT by increasing the number of professionals trained in this intervention. In particular, incorporating this technology-based platform may be especially useful as part of formal training opportunities (e.g., continuing education courses, coursework in graduate school).Although useful, this technology-based platform requires further development to maximize its potential. In this regard, future development and research efforts must focus on incorporating other common BPT skills (e.g., active ignoring), understanding whether the live remote coaching results in incremental effects over the web-based tutorial, considering how best to further support individuals who respond differently to initial training efforts (e.g., adaptive, ongoing training), considering what additional approaches may be needed to ensure maintenance of training effects over time, and ensuring translation of clinical skills from analogue to actual naturalistic practice contexts. As a case in point, the four BPT skills were chosen because they are the foundation for which subsequent skills are administered (e.g., praise is an essential skill that underlies other skills, including shaping and planned attention). Future research examining whether there are particular skills that lend themselves to a hybrid or traditional face-to-face platform is a critical next step in order to move the field forward. This study suggests that this technology-based platform offers a strong foundation for training, which has the potential for significantly advancing the dissemination of a highly effective intervention for a ubiquitous childhood mental health challenge. In the United States, many of the states with the lowest percentage of licensed psychologists also have the highest number of people with mental illness (Hamp, Stamm, Christidis, & Nigrinis, 2014). Psychiatrists, psychologists, and social workers commonly establish their practice within higher-population, affluent, urban areas and larger cities with one or more major universities (Kazdin & Blase, 2011). On the other hand, across the United States, approximately 20% of the population, or 60 million people, live within rural areas (Stamm, 2003; U.S. Census Bureau, 2015). Even accessing mental health treatment within larger cities and affluent, urban areas can be difficult for many people dealing with mental health issues because of transportation issues (Collins, Westra, Dozois, & Burns, 2004). One potential ingredient to a more comprehensive solution to limited access to mental health treatment based on geography or transportation is telepsychology. A survey after a 3-month study using telepsychology for child assessments indicated that approximately 97% of parents appreciated eliminating the need to commute (Elford et al., 2001).The American Psychological Association (APA) defines telepsychology as the use of telecommunication technologies to provide psychological services (APA, 2015). This paper’s discussion of telepsychology is limited to the use of video-conferencing technology to deliver psychological services. This includes video-conferencing technology to connect participants in different medical centers, computer to home, and remote therapy utilizing smart phones. Telepsychology offers psychologists and clients a number of advantages over traditional, in-person modes of therapy. Individuals’ physical restrictions, limited time, or psychological symptoms can hinder their ability to attend sessions in person (Martin, 2013). Telepsychology can help psychologists begin to overcome these obstacles.Psychologists practicing within rural communities are more likely to encounter current and past clients during community activities, confront interconnected relationships within their own familial and social networks and those of their clients, and even face intersecting business interests (Schank & Skovholt, 1997). These overlapping roles can lead to a number of ethical dilemmas to navigate (Pope & Vasquez, 2011). Telepsychology can decrease the probability of these situations by granting psychologists the ability to extend their practice beyond geographical limitations (McCord et al., 2011). This can also result in a larger pool of potential clients rather than relying on members of the surrounding community (Centore & Milacci, 2008). Additionally, telepsychology could be used to connect individuals with psychologists who are fluent in their language or competent with their diagnosis or multicultural concerns (Hailey, Roine, & Ohinmaa, 2008; Yellowlees, Marks, Hilty, & Shore, 2008).Evidence also suggests that telepsychology adoption may result in lower costs across a variety of settings. A study comparing delivery methods for treating bulimia nervosa indicated that telepsychology was $2,024.28 cheaper per recovered client than in-person therapy (Crow et al., 2009). Studies on telepsychology adoption within correctional facilities show savings ranging from $12,000 to $1 million in savings (Deslich, Thistlethwaite, & Coustasse, 2013). Between 2006 and 2010, the U.S. Veteran’s Administration recorded a drop of approximately 25% in psychiatric admissions and length of hospitalization for telepsychology patients (Godleski, Darkins, & Peters, 2012).The question of telepsychology’s effectiveness has been examined since 1967, when it was first successfully used to connect mental health providers in Boston’s Massachusetts General Hospital in with patients nearly three miles away within Logan International Airport (Dwyer, 1973). Backhaus and colleagues (2012) conducted a thorough meta-analysis examining multiple aspects of telepsychology including randomized clinical trials (RCTs) comparing clinical outcome data between in-person therapy with telepsychology. Results suggested that outcomes in symptom reduction and levels of functioning were similar between telepsychology and in-person therapy when treating people for issues depression, anxiety, PTSD, or substance abuse. More recently, results of a similar 2018 meta-analysis of two-dozen RCT noninferiority studies indicated telepsychology is as effective as in-person therapy when treating individuals diagnosed with anxiety, depression, PTSD, and adjustment disorder (Varker, Brand, Ward, Terhaag, & Phelps, 2018).Telepsychology practitioners in the United States must comply with a complex set of state laws and federal requirements outlined within the Affordable Care Act, H.R. 4872 (2010) and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA). Furthermore, for psychologists specifically, there are a number of American Psychological Association (APA) requirements for telepsychology competency, ethical considerations, and data security (American Psychological Association, 2015). Although these additional requirements are reasonable and necessary considering the potential risks involved, they may contribute to psychologists’ decision to exclude telepsychology within their own practice.A common barrier to telepsychology that psychologists within the United States face is the possibility of practicing across state lines (Kramer, Kinn, & Mishkind, 2015). Although the APA acts as a nationwide accrediting body for education and training programs for psychologists (APA, 2016), individual states maintain control over enforcement and licensure requirements for individual psychologists to protect members of the public. When practicing across state lines, such permission is typically temporary (if granted), and therefore considering a long-term telepsychology practice often requires formal licensure in multiple states. Laws concerning the practice of psychology focus on the location of the client and not that of the psychologist (Kramer et al., 2015). As a result, the psychologist must meet interjurisdictional practice requirements within the state in which the client is currently located (APA, 2015; Association of State and Provincial Psychology Boards, 2016a). Some states may allow psychologists licensed out-of-state to practice under specific conditions for anywhere from 10 to 30 days within a calendar year (DeAngelis, 2012). California’s Board of Behavioral Sciences (BBS) released a bulletin warning consumers that when they travel, if they contact their psychologist for assistance using the Internet, a phone, or any electronic method, the psychologist must first verify that the state the client is in will permit them to provide therapy (California Board of Behavioral Sciences, 2016).Another issue facing psychologists interested in implementing telepsychology is using a network and video-conferencing platform that is HIPAA compliant. Although HIPAA’s Security Rules protect an individual’s electronic patient health information (ePHI), it does not apply to videoconferencing. However, HIPAA’s Privacy Rule does (U.S. Department of Health & Human Services, 2010). Among the HIPAA Privacy Rule’s requirements are access and audit control, breach notification, person or entity authentication, transmission security, workstation security, device and media controls, and a security management process (HIPAA). HIPAA does not certify the compliance of software, but companies willing to assume responsibility for collected data can claim HIPAA compliance.Skype, a popular and free video-conferencing software package, meets some HIPAA requirements such as entity authentication and robust encryption by current standards to facilitate transmission security (APA, 2014). Where Skype falls short is audit control, meaning its inability to monitor accesses to ePHI. Skype also lacks breach notification to let administrators know when unauthorized users access ePHI (APA, 2014). As with HIPAA compliance, the robust requirements surrounding data encryption and security can be a daunting task (APA, 2015). Experts in computer security and cryptography have argued that it is not possible to develop tamper-proof computer systems, only tamper-evident ones (Schneier, 2011). Considering how little direct control psychologists maintain once they transmit data outside the walls of their practice, fears of data theft may be another source of reservation against use of telepsychology. There are services such as BetterHelp, Regain, TalkSpace, and Breakthrough that advertise HIPAA compliance, and may include confidentiality agreements, robust data encryption, and liability insurance imbedded within the package. Standards continue to evolve in terms of coverage that are enabling increasing opportunities for practice and the market attempting to overcome barriers. Along those lines, Maheu et al. (2017) point out (and are attempting to address) the substantial need for tools to assist clinicians as they sort through available technologies and objectively determine which ones are clinically appropriate for their practice.Psychologists using telepsychology expecting financial reimbursement from health insurance companies or publicly funded health care programs must first verify for each client if, and under what conditions, the third party will reimburse them for their services. Although Medicare does not specify where a psychologist has to be located (e.g., health clinic, independent practice, at home), it will not cover telehealth interventions unless the client receives treatment within a doctor’s office, hospital, authorized health care center, or nursing facility (Medicare, 2016). Blue Cross and Blue Shield, an association of health care insurance providers insuring more than 106 million individuals (Blue Cross and Blue Shield, 2016a), will reimburse for telepsychology if the psychologist is part of specific online care providers network (Blue Cross and Blue Shield, 2015, 2016b).A number of states have passed legislation requiring private insurance companies to cover policyholders seeking telepsychology treatment. Arizona’s Telemedicine Reimbursement Parity Act (2013) requires private insurers to cover individuals receiving health services (including mental health) via video conferencing if they live in counties with populations under 900,000 or people who live more than 30 miles from the nearest city. The California Insurance Code (2011) prohibits private insurers from requiring individuals meet in-person with health care providers, or from dictating the type of setting they meet within. Meanwhile, a number of states including Florida, Idaho, Kansas, Nebraska, Nevada, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and North Carolina do not have laws mandating private insurers cover telepsychology.Although no research to date has looked at personal or environmental characteristics of psychologists as predictors of telepsychology adoption (or any health care provider group for that matter with telehealth), a potential guide may be found in research investigating adoption of evidence-based practices (EBPs) examining individual and setting characteristics as potential factors in the adoption of new practice approaches. This is not to conflate EBPs and telepsychology, as telepsychology may be a modality for implementing EBPs, but it is itself not an EBP. These factors include individual characteristics such as older age, female sex, White race/ethnicity, fewer years of experience (Aarons et al., 2010), treatment setting, treatment focus, and organizational culture (Aarons, 2004).Results from a study of 322 clinical service workers representing 51 different mental health programs for children, adolescents, and their families indicate adoption of EBPs depends on organizational qualities and individual attributes (Aarons, 2004). Higher positive attitudes toward adopting EBPs were seen in intern-level practitioners rather than more senior practitioners, and those with higher levels of education. Understandably, organizational culture and mission are also contexts for change. When required to adopt EBPs by the organization, providers working in day-treatment programs had more positive attitudes toward adoption of EBPs than practitioners working in outpatient programs. Providers also reported more positive attitudes toward EBPs when working within organizations with lower levels of bureaucracy, wraparound programs, and programs with written practice policies (Aarons, 2004).Perle, Burt, and Higgins (2014) examined psychologists’ self-reported attitudes toward telepsychology. Close to 80% indicated they viewed telepsychology interventions as effective, but 42% viewed telepsychology less effective than in-person therapy. Almost 75% of the sample also indicated they were not likely to refer someone for telepsychology services. Results revealed that scarcity of referral sources, privacy issues, legal concerns, client safety, perceived lack of research, reimbursement concerns, and insufficient training resulted in hesitation to adopt telepsychology. Additionally, early career psychologists (practicing 10 years or less) report higher levels of concern about insufficient training with telehealth (Glueckauf et al., 2018). Topics emphasized among those interested in further training were ethical and legal issues, efficacy data including research comparing telepsychology with traditional modalities, safety/crisis information, reimbursement procedures, system costs, and training in setting up a telepsychology practice (Perle et al., 2014).The purpose of the current study is to identify significant demographic, organizational, and clinical factors of psychologists’ use of telepsychology within their practice. Based on previous literature examining the adoption of new practice approaches (Aarons, 2004; Aarons et al., 2010; Perle et al., 2014), it is hypothesized that the following variables will predict greater intention to use telepsychology: older age, female gender, White race/ethnicity, fewer years of experience, a more highly structured treatment setting, rural location of practice, the existence of organizational policies concerning telepsychology, and previous training in the use of telepsychology. The selection of these factors was guided by their potential for informing future interventions aiding telepsychology adoption at both the individual and organizational levels.MethodParticipantsTo participate, individuals had to (a) be aged 18 or older, (b) possess a doctorate, (c) be a licensed psychologist, and (d) be currently practicing psychotherapy. A database of potential participants was generated using psychology newsgroups, membership rosters from professional organizations, and counseling center mental health facility websites. These sources were selected because they allowed outside research invitations and provided a large enough pool of potential participants for adequate analysis. Data were collected from July 6th, 2017 until July 26th, 2017 and resulted in 1,799 completed surveys. Eight surveys were discarded because participants provided implausible answers to both their age and years in practice, or they entered nonsense answers to a significant portion of the survey or the validity check question (“In one sentence or less, what do you think the purpose of this study was?”). This yielded a total of 1,791 complete and valid surveys (see Table 1).TABLES AND FIGUREStable/figure thumbnailTable 1. Summary of Participant CharacteristicsView larger image > in this page > in new window> Download slideSample demographics on age, gender, and race/ethnicity are similar to provider statistics within a 2015 APA report (Stamm, Lin, & Christidis, 2017). The sample also had representation from all 50 states, as well as each treatment focus and approach proposed within the survey.MeasuresParticipants were asked to provide demographic data about themselves (age, gender, race/ethnicity, years in practice), and information about their practice including their practice location (urban, suburban, rural), training and current use of telepsychology (yes or no), and whether policies permitting telepsychology exist within their organization. Participants were asked, “What is your theoretical therapeutic approach (select all that apply)?” and “What is the treatment focus of your primary mental health services setting (select all that apply)?” Most of these items were simple demographic items commonly used in psychology research studies, and no formal scales had been developed to date assessing the constructs in any more comprehensive way. As a result, all items were researcher-generated and informed by foci of previous studies. Because all items are standalone, no indices of internal reliability are applicable.ProcedurePotential participants received an e-mail invitation to participate in a 10-min study that “examines the feasibility of different treatment approaches in mental health practice.” No reference to telepsychology was made in the recruitment e-mail in an effort to not select for psychologists who were highly interested in telepsychology. Participants who followed the HTML link in the e-mail were presented with an institutional review board-approved informed consent document, to which they had to agree to participate. Then, participants were presented with a screener section of the Qualtrics web platform and had to respond affirmatively to the following questions to be allowed to participate: (a) Are you licensed to practice as a psychologist in the United States?; (b) Are you currently practicing psychotherapy?; and (c) Are you at least 18 years of age? Participants then completed a number of questions about themselves and their practice. They read the following: “For the purpose of this survey, ‘telepsychology’ refers the use of video conferencing technology to provide psychotherapy.” They then answered questions about their use of telepsychology.Data AnalysisThree logistic regressions were run to examine potential statistical predictors of current telepsychology use. The first included the following predictors: age, gender, race/ethnicity, existence of organizational policies supporting telepsychology, prior training in the use of telepsychology, and geographic location of practice. The second including the following dummy-coded (0 vs. 1) primary practice setting predictors: Correctional facility, geriatric facility, academic medical center, VA, individual/group practice, residential treatment facility, and school/university. The third included a number of dummy-coded treatment foci of participants’ primary practice setting. These analyses were conducted using SPSS Version 24.0 (Arbuckle, 2016). Significance was established at an alpha level of .05, two-tailed.ResultsLogistic Regression 1A logistic regression was used to model the binary variable of current use of telepsychology (with not currently using as the reference category) and with binary statistical predictor variables of gender (woman vs. other), race/ethnicity (White/European American vs. minority), rural location or not, the existence of organizational policies supporting telepsychology, whether participants have received training in the use of telepsychology, and the quantitative predictor variable of age (years of clinical practice was fully multicollinear, so age was chosen instead). The model provided a statistically significant prediction of current use of telepsychology, χ2(6) = 383.81, p < .001. The Nagelkerke pseudo R2 indicated the model accounted for 29.8% of the total variance.When controlling for the other factors, the likelihood of participants using telepsychology was approximately 8.74 times higher for psychologists practicing in organizations where policies supporting telepsychology exist (p < .001) than those practicing within organizations without supporting policies. Also, psychologists who had received training in telepsychology were 2.25 times more likely (p < .001) to use telepsychology than those who had not. The likelihood was .46 times lower for psychologists practicing in rural areas (p = .002) versus nonrural practitioners. No other factors exerted a unique effect on current use of telepsychology (see Table 2).TABLES AND FIGUREStable/figure thumbnailTable 2. Variables in Logistic Regression 1View larger image > in this page > in new window> Download slideLogistic Regression 2A second logistic regression was used to model the binary variable of current use of telepsychology using binary predictor variables reflecting the setting participants practice within. Although all participants were included in the analysis, practice setting categories that were endorsed by 15 or fewer participants, irrespective of the size of their practice, were not given their own dummy code which resulted in excluding specific comparisons for psychologists practicing in a career center, employee assistance program, or religious organization. The model provided a statistically significant prediction of current use of telepsychology, χ2(7) = 63.015, p < .001. The Nagelkerke pseudo R2 indicated the model accounted for 5.3% of the total variance.When controlling for the other factors, the likelihood of participants using telepsychology was 3.37 times higher for psychologists practicing in Veterans Affairs Medical Centers (p = .001) than non-VA psychologists. Psychologists practicing in individual or group practice were 2.86 times higher for (p < .001), than psychologists working within public or institutional settings such as hospitals, schools, and geriatric facilities. No other predictors exerted a unique effect on current use of telepsychology (see Table 3).TABLES AND FIGUREStable/figure thumbnailTable 3.

The model provided a statistically significant prediction of current use of telepsychology, χ2(54) = 158.172, p < .001. The Nagelkerke pseudo R2 indicated the model accounted for 13.1% of the total variance.When controlling for the other factors, the likelihood of participants using telepsychology was approximately 1.86 times higher for psychologists focusing on sports performance (p = .020), 1.83 times higher for life coaching (p = .002), 1.70 times higher for treating narcissistic personality (p = .008), 1.60 times higher for treating addiction (p = .004), 1.47 times higher for marital and premarital counseling (p = .011), 1.42 times higher for focusing on parenting (p = .040), and 1.42 times higher for treating eating disorders (p = .049). The likelihood was .69 times lower for psychologists providing testing and evaluation (p = .024), .67 times lower when treating grief (p = .012), .64 times lower with treating bipolar disorder (p = .006), .64 times lower when focused on treatment compliance/medication management (p = .028), .60 times lower when treating obesity (p = .022), .50 times lower when treating antisocial personality (p = .024), and .47 times lower for psychologists focused on racial identity (p = .009) when compared with psychologists who did not identify with each category. No other factors exerted a unique effect on current use of telepsychology (see Table 4).TABLES AND FIGUREStable/figure thumbnailTable 4. Variables in Logistic Regression 3View larger image > in this page > in new window> Download slideDiscussionFor the purpose of this paper and this discussion, the use of the term telepsychology refers the use of video conferencing technology to provide psychotherapy. Telepsychology has the ability to help psychologists assist individuals who, for a number of reasons, may have reduced ability to attend traditional in-person therapy. The purpose of this study was to examine factors that statistically predict psychologists’ decision to use telepsychology in their own practice. Generally, results revealed psychologists are more likely to use telepsychology if there are telepsychology-supportive organizational policies in their place of practice and if they believe they were adequately trained to use telepsychology. This finding is similar to previous research literature in which mental health providers reported more favorable attitudes toward adopting new EBPs when their organization has written policies in place (Aarons, 2004). This also aligns with previous research indicating that two thirds of psychological professionals, especially early career practitioners, perceived they did not possess sufficient training to work with their clients using telepsychology (Glueckauf et al., 2018; Perle et al., 2014).There was a higher likelihood of using telepsychology among psychologists who provided life coaching and those who treated individuals with narcissistic personalities. It is possible that the percentages for coaching and performance consulting were higher because those activities may encounter fewer regulations than others. Also, psychologists within U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Medical Centers or practicing in an individual/group practice were more likely to use telepsychology. The VA results are not surprising when the importance of policies and training on use of telepsychology are considered. The VA has implemented a very robust, multistage training program to teach practitioners how to initiate and conduct telepsychology and telehealth interventions. They have also established a number of policies concerning the use of telepsychology and continue to address current interjurisdictional barriers blocking VA practitioners from using telepsychology to treat veterans across state lines when veterans are not within a VA facility (Authority of Health Care Providers to Practice Telehealth, 2017). Their continued endorsement of this mode of treatment is evident in the more than 2 million telehealth sessions used during the fiscal year of 2016 to assist veterans within their care, and their rollout of VA Video Connect system allowing veterans to participate in telehealth sessions using their own computers and smartphones (U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, 2017). Conversely, the increased use of telepsychology among psychologists in individual/group practice may be the result of working within a low-bureaucracy environment where psychologists themselves can make their own decisions about telepsychology clinical practice. With that said, the level of reported favorability was not as high as VA psychologists which may reflect a slight fear of sanctions as a potential limiting influence.Results also indicated higher likelihood of telepsychology use among psychologists who provided marital/premarital counseling, or parenting support. These results align with a study by Aarons (2004) indicating that practitioners within wraparound programs for children and families were more likely to adopt new EBPs. Also, parents receiving counseling via telepsychology rated their satisfaction with the experience very highly, in part because it was easier to fit sessions into their schedules by avoiding commute times (Elford et al., 2001).On the other hand, psychologists were less likely to use telepsychology if they practiced within a rural area. This result was unexpected considering telepsychology could allow practitioners in rural areas to reach a greater number of individuals while decreasing the chances of dual relationships (Centore & Milacci, 2008; McCord et al., 2011). It may be the case that rural practitioners judge their resources are too limited to acquire and support a telepsychology platform, although future research on this topic is required.Psychologists focused on treatment compliance/medication management, bipolar disorder, obesity, grief, and antisocial personality were less likely to use telepsychology. Perhaps those who were treating more acutely ill clients were not using telepsychology because they felt doing so entailed unnecessary and increased risk. Psychologists who provided testing and evaluation were also less likely to use telepsychology. Although some common assessments have been validated and normed using telepsychology, many require adapting the assessment or finding an alternative assessment if adaptation cannot be accomplished (Luxton, Pruitt, & Osenbach, 2014). Also, while performing a battery of assessments, it is common practice to incorporate relevant interpersonal interactions into the final assessment. Psychologists working in this area may perceive they can achieve a more comprehensive assessment in-person. It may be that they work within institutions or locations that more easily facilitate in-person interactions.The current findings suggest that identifying as a woman was not a significant statistical predictor of telepsychology use. This is in contrast with the results of a study indicating that women who provide mental health services were more likely to adopt EBPs when compared with men (Aarons et al., 2010). These results do agree with results from an earlier study demonstrating women were no more open to adopting EBPs than men were (Aarons, 2004).Age was also not found to be a significant statistical predictor of telepsychology use. Preliminary analysis revealed age and experience were highly correlated with one another, so because of this, only age was tested as a predictor. The multicollinearity of the two variables means experience would have yielded a similar result. This was unexpected in consideration of previous literature indicating older individuals and individuals early in their careers were more open to new EBPs (Aarons, 2004; Aarons et al., 2010). However, it does undermine the stereotype that older individuals are less likely to adopt new technologies.ImplicationsThe results suggest a number of implications. Organizations interested in implementing telepsychology may benefit from creating policies supporting its use and provide adequate training, as these were the two biggest statistical predictors of use. For example, the VA has developed very specific policies surrounding the use of telepsychology (U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, 2017), which might account for the substantial increased use of telepsychology found in the current study among psychologists working in the VA.For government and regulatory entities, creating clear, specific, and consistent laws governing the use of telepsychology could potentially encourage more psychologists to treat individuals currently restricted from mental health services by time or geography. States with too few mental health professionals might make telepsychology more useful and easier to use by easing current rules concerning interjurisdictional practice. The Association of State and Provincial Psychology Boards (ASPPB) is already moving in this direction and has developed Psychology Interjurisdictional Compact (PSYPACT), intended to facilitate telepsychology across state lines (Association of State and Provincial Psychology, 2016b). States that enact PSYPACT into law would allow psychologists to conduct telepsychology with clients located within other PSYPACT states without holding a license in the client’s state. Currently, only eight states have enacted PSYPACT legislation at the time of this writing. The findings from this study could potentially support the passage of such legislation as a way to increase psychologists’ adoption of telepsychology. Additionally, legislation requiring insurance companies to reimburse for telepsychology sessions may increase psychologists’ perceptions concerning telepsychology’s ease of use and usefulness for themselves and their clients. Currently, there are 30 states that have passed such laws with another seven with proposed legislation under consideration (American Telemedicine Association, 2017).Limitations and Future DirectionsThe current study possesses a number of limitations and as a result offers directions for future research. Internet-based surveys can lead to bias because the researcher has no control over who chooses to participate (Anderson & Kanuka, 2003; Leary, 2012). This form of sampling may have led to a participant sample possessing a higher level of acceptance of technology than a more comprehensive but costly sampling method. Despite this limitation, the geographic diversity across all 50 U.S. states was only achievable using an Internet-based approach. A large proportion (65.5%) of participants indicated they worked within independent practice, whereas the APA reports this sample characteristic should be closer to 44.7% (Stamm et al., 2017). As a result, conclusions based on these findings may not be fully reflective of the population of practicing psychologists in the United States and should be made with caution. The results contained a mix of large-, medium-, and small-sized effects. The large sample size allowed the analyses to pick up on even small-sized effects, though the implications of these findings should be tempered accordingly when considering small-sized effects. Also, considering the large number of analyses, there is an increased likelihood that some results, especially the results with smaller p values, are a result of chance. Consequently, caution should be maintained when interpreting these results.Another weakness in the current study is that participants were not asked to specify if they were primarily connecting to clients at home, a clinic, or somewhere else. Also, participants were not asked how much telepsychology is a part of their overall practice. Doing so would have provided a more comprehensive and nuanced picture of how telepsychology is being implemented. For example, a number of neuropsychology assessments are not appropriate, or have not yet been fully adapted, for use via telepsychology. Data concerning what aspects of telepsychology are working well, what forms of telepsychology need work, and what activities of treatment or assessment currently disqualify telepsychology as a viable option could provide a more complete exploration of psychologists’ perceptions and experiences about telepsychology. Additionally, demographic predictors such as gender, socioeconomic status, and race/ethnicity of clients were not examined to determine whether some populations vary in their receptivity or responsiveness to telepsychology. Future research in this direction may reveal additional considerations for psychologists when contemplating telepsychology’s place within their practice. Another potential area for further research is to understand why rural psychologists reported a lower likelihood of adopting telepsychology compared with nonrural ones, despite the benefits of a larger pool of prospective clients across the state(s) in which they are licensed, and the improved access to mental health services for rural populations.Finally, the current study did not seek to determine what barriers to adoption exist for psychologists across a variety of treatment emphases. It is also important to examine current challenges to telepsychology’s overall effectiveness. Asking these questions in future research could elucidate what features are required to facilitate different interventions, and indicate which ones are not currently adaptable and where psychologists perceive current methods and technologies fall short of what is needed to engender lasting and substantive support for demonstrably effective interventions using the technology.ConclusionsPsychologists were more likely to engage in telepsychology if they had received specific training in it, or practice in a setting with policies supporting the use of telepsychology. Psychologists with particular treatment emphases, working within the VA, and to a lesser degree, psychologists in a group or individual practice were more likely to use telepsychology. On the other hand, psychologists within rural areas or some treatment emphases were less likely to use it. Organizations, training institutions, application developers, private organizations, and public institutions can all play a part in shaping current and future psychologists’ perceptions concerning the use of telepsychology. Doing so could benefit a number of regions in the United States by increasing access to mental health services for people who are currently facing no treatment options. IntroductionTraumatic brain injury (TBI) represents the leading cause of death and disability in childhood. More than 600,000 children and adolescents are seen in emergency departments across the United States each year as a result of TBI, and early childhood and adolescence represents two peaks in TBI incidence across the life span (Taylor, Bell, Breiding, & Xu, 2017). Children and adolescents who have sustained a moderate to severe TBI are at risk of developing a range of psychological and physical health issues, including attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, depression, learning disorders, and speech/language difficulties (Albicini & McKinlay, 2015; Bloom et al., 2001; Haarbauer-Krupa et al., 2018; Li & Liu, 2013; Max et al., 1997, 1998; Schwartz et al., 2003). Although children and adolescents with a moderate to severe TBI represent a pediatric population with heightened need for psychological services, many of their behavioral health needs are unmet (Karver et al., 2014). This is likely attributable in part to difficulties accessing specialized services or traditional in-office care resulting from injury-related barriers such as fatigue and motor problems, as well as general barriers to help-seeking such as living in rural areas (Ronzio, Guagliardo, & Persaud, 2006), lack of transportation, and lack of time.In recent years, the advent of inexpensive videoconferencing programs, integrated web or phone cameras, and ever-expanding Internet access have made the possibility of delivering physical and behavioral health interventions via web-based platforms increasingly feasible and cost-effective. Indeed, telepsychology, that is, the “provision of psychological services using telecommunication technologies,” such as with mobile devices, text messaging, and e-mail is a growing field (American Psychology Association, Joint Task Force for the Development of Telepsychology Guidelines for Psychologists, 2013). Telepsychology, and the broader use of telehealth to deliver both physical and behavioral health interventions, increases accessibility to care for a wide range of populations. For example, videoconferencing software enables families living in rural areas to engage in synchronous communication with a psychologist, without having to travel long distances to a primary care facility.Telepsychology may be uniquely suited to the needs of children and families impacted by a range of pediatric concerns requiring rehabilitation care, including TBI. This is because children and families can access interventions from their home, and do not have to concern themselves with arranging child-care, or traveling with a child who may have health concerns, physical disabilities, and/or severe emotional or behavioral challenges. Although telepsychology may increase accessibility, telepsychology interventions with children and families impacted by pediatric conditions may pose unique difficulties such as challenges associated with the child’s developmental level, motor issues, behavioral challenges, as well as difficulties engaging multiple participants (i.e., parent/s and their children) without the psychologist being physically present (Slone, Reese, & McClellan, 2012). Moreover, conditions that impair attention and executive function skills (e.g., attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and cognitive impairment attributable to TBI) may render telehealth approaches less effective than face-to-face treatment. Nonetheless, telehealth and telepsychology interventions have been increasingly used with a variety of pediatric populations such as children with traumatic brain injury, chronic pain, obesity, cancer, and encopresis (e.g., Davis, Sampilo, Gallagher, Landrum, & Malone, 2013; Palermo, Wilson, Peters, Lewandowski, & Somhegyi, 2009; Richardson, Frueh, Grubaugh, Egede, & Elhai, 2009; Ritterband et al., 2008; Van Allen, Davis, & Lassen, 2011; Wade et al., 2015).Recognizing both the need for services and the barriers to care, Wade and colleagues have spent the past 15 years developing and testing web-based interventions for children/families impacted by pediatric TBI. The interventions and data regarding their efficacy are described in greater detail elsewhere (Antonini et al., 2014; Antonini, Raj, Oberjohn, & Wade, 2012; Wade et al., 2014; Wade et al., 2015; Wade, Walz, Carey, & Williams, 2008). In brief, these web-based interventions were delivered to children and adolescents with moderate to severe TBI and at least one of their caregivers. The intervention for younger children (ages 3 to 9 years), Internet-Interacting Together Everyday (I-InTERACT), was a positive parenting skills intervention in which parents learned positive parenting skills via web content and also received live coaching of these skills during weekly videoconference sessions with a clinician. The interventions for adolescents and their caregiver/s, Counselor Assisted Problem Solving (CAPS) and Teen Online Problem Solving (TOPS), provided training in problem-solving skills, self-regulation, and communication (Nezu & D’zurilla, 2006). Similar to I-InTERACT, families accessed information via web-content before weekly meetings with a clinician via synchronous videoconferencing to discuss, practice, and role-play skills. To bridge the digital divide and enable all families to participate (Calvert, Rideout, Woolard, Barr, & Strouse, 2005), families without existing home computers were provided with computers and web cameras, and all participants were reimbursed for high-speed Internet access for 6 months. Data collected since 2002 from families involved in these studies support the feasibility, acceptability, and efficacy of a telehealth treatment approach for children and families impacted by pediatric TBI (Antonini et al., 2012, 2014; Narad et al., 2015; Raj et al., 2015; Wade et al., 2008, 2012, 2014, 2015).In additional studies with children and families impacted by pediatric TBI, there has been research supporting the efficacy of telepsychology interventions in improving child behavioral outcomes and supporting caregiver functioning in other pediatric populations (e.g., Palermo et al., 2009; Richardson et al., 2009; Slone et al., 2012; Van Allen, Davis, & Lassen, 2011). However, although the evidence base for telepsychology is increasing, little is known about clinician perceptions and experiences delivering telepsychology. One exception is a review of telemedicine in pediatric psychology by Van Allen and colleagues (2011), which included a summary of how telepsychology was delivered at a single site and anecdotal descriptions of clinician experiences and satisfaction. Clinicians at this site reported high satisfaction delivering telepsychology, though they also reported that very young children did not respond as well and that therapies which required a high level of interaction, such as play therapy, were less feasible via telehealth (Van Allen et al., 2011). More rigorous research with multiple sites is needed to gain a more cohesive understanding of clinician experiences and satisfaction delivering telepsychology.Clinician perceptions delivering telepsychology are also important because this feedback can help determine profiles of children/families who may be more likely to benefit from one intervention modality over another (e.g., a better fit with an in-office intervention vs. telepsychology). In addition, clinician perspectives regarding advantages and challenges can inform intervention delivery and serve to improve both client and clinician satisfaction. Finally, feedback from clinicians who have delivered in-office and web-based interventions can help determine qualities of clinicians who may find one modality more effective and satisfying than the other. The broad aim of this study was to explore and describe clinician experiences delivering telehealth interventions to children/families impacted by pediatric TBI as part of a number of research studies. Satisfaction data from families who participated in these studies have been largely positive, with parents reporting high levels of satisfaction with the intervention and online delivery format (Antonini et al., 2012; Wade, Walz, Carey, & Williams, 2009; Wade, Wolfe, & Pestian, 2004). However, little is known about clinician experiences and perceptions of advantages and disadvantages of using telehealth over the traditional in-office, face-to-face treatment format. To broaden stakeholder input, we invited all clinicians who had delivered online therapies for pediatric TBI in past and present interventions to participate in this study. In addition to clinician experiences, we were interested in gaining clinician perceptions of advantages and limitations of telepsychology treatments for children and families impacted by pediatric TBI. We also sought to understand clinician perspectives on the family and clinician factors that supported the utility and efficacy of telepsychology for pediatric TBI. We expected clinicians to report online delivery to be similar to face-to-face on most dimensions examined, with some areas where online delivery is favorable and others where face-to-face delivery is preferable.MethodParticipantsClinicians, including licensed psychologists, psychology fellows, and advanced doctoral students, who delivered telepsychology interventions to children/adolescents and families impacted by pediatric TBI as part of a series of eight clinical trials were invited to participate. These trials took place between 2002 and 2017, and were conducted at six large tertiary care hospitals in Colorado, Minnesota, and Ohio. Demographic characteristics of these families varied widely by parental education, income, and urban versus rural place of residence (Antonini et al., 2014; Wade et al., 2017, 2018). Six of these trials involved family centered cognitive–behavioral therapy with the child, ages 11–19, one or both parents, and siblings when possible. Sessions focused on helping the child and family to cope more effectively with the challenges they were facing. In these studies, time since injury ranged from 0–24 months. Two trials involved parent skills training with live coaching and included the child ages 3–9, and one or both parents. This treatment focused on the parent’s interaction with the child. For both treatments, sessions were held weekly to biweekly for a period of four to six months. All but three of the therapists delivered both treatments. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the primary hospital where the intervention studies were based. The interventions were delivered using varying videoconferencing platforms over the years, including Polycom Viavideo, Skype, Movi, and Facetime, and most sessions conducted after 2006 were delivered via Skype.All previous and current clinicians (n = 17) were invited to participate. Of those, three either failed to respond to the request or were unable to be contacted, resulting in a participation rate of 76% (n = 13) for the surveys and 82% (n = 14) for the focus groups/key-informant interviews (one clinician who participated in the key-informant interview did not complete a survey). At the time of treatment delivery, six of the clinicians were licensed psychologists, one was an unlicensed psychology postdoctoral fellow, and seven were advanced clinical psychology graduate students. At the time of the present study, 10 were licensed psychologists and four were unlicensed postdoctoral fellows in clinical psychology. When the surveys and interviews were conducted, six clinicians were actively delivering both face-to-face and telehealth interventions to adolescents with TBI, and time since delivery of the treatment protocol and the present study for the remaining clinicians ranged from 1 to 5 years. A few clinicians (n = 2) had previously delivered phone-based interventions, but most clinicians had not delivered telepsychology interventions before working on these clinical trials. Clinicians who participated in this study delivered the telepsychology interventions described above to between 14 and upward of 50 children/adolescents and families. All but one clinician were female.MeasuresTelepsychology surveyParticipants completed a survey comparing telepsychology (delivered via synchronous videoconferencing) to face-to-face therapy on 16 dimensions commonly addressed in psychotherapy research (e.g., therapeutic alliance, reading nonverbal cues, family motivation, clinician engagement, etc.; see Table 1TABLES AND FIGUREStable/figure thumbnailTable 1. Clinician Ratings of Telepsychology Versus Face-to-Face TreatmentsView larger image > in this page > in new window> Download slidefor a complete list). The survey was developed by the research team to capture a range of factors salient to the delivery and experiences of clinicians providing psychotherapy to children/adolescents and families. Participants were asked to rate each item on a 5-point scale with the options ranging from 1 = face-to-face much better than online; 2 = face-to-face somewhat better than online; 3 = face-to-face and online about the same; 4 = online somewhat better than face-to-face; to 5 = online much better than face-to-face. To facilitate interpretation, responses were collapsed into the following three categories: (a) face-to-face better than online (survey score of 1 or 2); (b) face-to-face equivalent to online (survey score of 3); and (c) online better than face-to-face (survey score of 4 or 5). In addition to ratings, each item was followed by a space for comments where participants were encouraged to qualify their responses. This open-ended feedback was analyzed together with the focus group and key-informant interview data described below.Focus group/interviewsIn addition to completing surveys, clinicians were invited to participate in one of two focus groups, and those who were unable to attend either of the focus groups completed a key informant interview covering similar content. The aims of the focus groups/interviews were to gain a richer understanding of clinician experiences and to provide context and detail to survey responses. The research team developed a semistructured interview protocol for the focus groups/interviews which included open-ended questions and prompts (e.g., “Describe your experience delivering telepsychology interventions”; “What are the advantages/disadvantages you perceive between delivering behavioral health interventions via telepsychology vs. face-to-face?”; and “Think about families you have worked with, identify qualities of families that you feel are poised to benefit more from web-based interventions over face-to-face sessions, and vice versa”). Nine clinicians participated in the focus groups (five in the first, four in the second), and the remaining five clinicians completed key informant interviews using the same semistructured protocol as the focus groups. All focus groups and interviews were led by a licensed clinical psychologist who was also the primary supervisor on the research studies. In addition, two postdoctoral fellows in clinical psychology helped facilitate the focus groups. Handwritten notes were made by the facilitator and both postdoctoral fellows during the focus groups and the facilitator took notes during the one-on-one interviews. Efforts were made to transcribe responses verbatim.AnalysesThis mixed-methods study utilized a sequential explanatory design (Creswell, 2013), whereby data collection and analyses were conducted in two stages. In the first stage, descriptive statistics were used to analyze the quantitative results from the surveys. In the second stage, qualitative data were gathered to qualify quantitative data and to provide a richer understanding of responses and findings. Qualitative data were examined using qualitative content analysis, which is a widely used approach in social science research (Zhang & Wildemuth, 2009). Given that the aim of the qualitative data was to expand and explain quantitate findings, a directed content analysis approach was used (Hsieh & Shannon, 2005). Consistent with this approach, the focus group/interview protocol included broad open-ended questions, as well as targeted questions that were guided by the quantitative responses of informants.Qualitative data analysis began with the research team reviewing open-ended responses to the surveys and reading notes from the focus groups/informant interviews. Responses were coded during group meetings by the team as a whole using some predetermined codes (e.g., ease of scheduling, technical difficulties), and new codes that emerged were duly added to relevant categories/clusters. Efforts to enhance trustworthiness of findings included regular “on the spot” member checks during interviews (i.e., clarifying what participants said). In addition, analysis was conducted by the entire team of researchers, all of whom have familiarity with telepsychology interventions. This team approach, and reliance on group consensus, helped minimize the effects of individual bias and preferences. When there were discrepant opinions about codes/themes, the researchers discussed and negotiated until they reached agreement. The high response rate helped minimize bias and provided the opportunity for a range of responses, as respondents included those who delivered telepsychology interventions when these interventions were still novel (i.e., more than 10 years ago) and those currently delivering telepsychology. Finally, details of the participants and the telepsychology interventions are provided throughout the results to give context to the findings and to aid readers in determining how transferable and generalizable findings are to other telepsychology interventions.ResultsWe begin by presenting results from the surveys (also see Table 1); specifically, a count of clinicians who rated a survey item as being either better, similar, or worse between telepsychology and face-to-face interventions. We then elaborate on these findings with qualitative responses in the interviews. We also summarize additional themes that emerged from the focus groups/interviews (see Table 2).TABLES AND FIGUREStable/figure thumbnailTable 2. Qualitative Feedback on Advantages and Disadvantages of Telepsychology Interventions and Characteristics of Families Likely to Benefit From Telepsychology Versus Face-to-Face TreatmentView larger image > in this page > in new window> Download slideContent reported in quotes represents verbatim responses from one or more participants.Dimensions Where Telepsychology Is Favorable to Face-to-Face InterventionThe greatest advantage of online delivery versus face-to-face reported was an increased understanding of the home environment (85% of respondents). In the interviews, clinicians described how telepsychology interventions delivered in the home enabled the clinician to “see the family in their natural environment and all the factors that were contributing to family dynamics and issues.” This provided “greater ecological validity” and enabled the clinician to intervene in vivo and to develop/problem-solve strategies that were pertinent to the family’s lived experience in the home. Another advantage of online interventions included less caregiver stigma/negative attitudes toward treatment (62%), as families seemed to perceive online interventions as “less threatening” than attending a face-to-face sessions. In particular, clinicians reported that telepsychology was less stigmatizing and superior for engaging adolescents and promoting participation from fathers and siblings.Clinicians also rated telepsychology as offering greater ease of scheduling (54%). Clinicians reported that an online delivery afforded more flexibility with regard to their own schedules. For example, clinicians reported that they could offer evening hours and could deliver the intervention from their home office, which was convenient for them, and increased accessibility for families. In addition, clinicians described how an online delivery made it easier for families who lived far away from treatment centers to receive interventions, and reduced financial burden on families related to travel, transportation, and childcare costs for siblings not participating in the intervention, when applicable.Dimensions Where Telepsychology Is Equivalent to Face-to-Face InterventionClinicians rated most dimensions assessed (11 of 17) as being equivalent between telepsychology and face-to-face. For example, therapeutic alliance was rated as equivalent to face-to-face interventions (85%). In describing their experiences, clinicians reported feeling “skeptical about how the rapport would be (prior to delivering online interventions)” and some remarked feeling “extremely pleased” or “pleasantly surprised to see warmth and rapport were consistent (with face-to-face interventions).” Although most clinician reported no difference in establishing rapport (54%), most reported in the interviews that there were additional skills “needed to make those connections and establish rapport” when delivering interventions via telepsychology. Clinicians reported that this was something “you learn as you do telepsychology.” Extending from this, although most clinicians reported similar levels of clinician engagement (70%), 30% of clinicians reported experiencing less engagement when delivering telepsychology. In describing this during the interviews, some clinicians reported having to work harder to deliver telepsychology, as they needed to be cognizant of multiple factors, such as, technological aspects of the intervention, attending to nonverbal communication, and addressing disruptions during sessions.Other dimensions that were rated similarly included completion of homework (77%), as well as parent (85%) and child engagement (70%). Most clinicians rated attendance as being similar (54%) and some rated attendance in telepsychology to be superior (31%). In the focus groups, some clinicians reported that families tended to reschedule online appointments more often than face-to-face sessions, given the perceived flexibility; though attendance was reportedly similar. Overall, clinicians felt that family attendance was “more to do with family functioning than the type of intervention modality.” They expressed the belief that families who struggled with attendance for online interventions would likely have also had attendance problems for in-person interventions and vice versa.Dimensions Where Face-to-Face Intervention Is Superior to TelepsychologyThe greatest disadvantage clinicians reported of telepsychology relative to face-to-face interventions was amount of disruptions during session (92%). For example, clinicians reported online sessions being disrupted by “people or pets walking in,” “multiple kids’ demanding caregiver attention,” as well as other household-related issues such as needing to attend to food on the stove. In essence, by delivering telepsychology to families in their home, both families and clinicians had to contend with other household demands/distractions. Although part of the training and clinician manual for these telepsychology interventions addressed setting boundaries around home-based sessions and problem-solving with families to minimize distractions, this issue remained a challenge for clinicians.Another disadvantage was reading nonverbal communication (70%). Reading nonverbal cues was reported to be particularly difficult in family treatment when there were more family members participating, as not everyone’s face would be clearly in view on the screen. In addition, the emotional climate and family tension were also noted as more difficult to read via telehealth than face-to-face. The other greatest disadvantage of telepsychology was technical/logistical challenges (85%). In the interviews, clinicians reported that there were some families who struggled with the technological aspects of the interventions, and assisting with these issues posed an additional burden on the clinician. A few clinicians expressed the view that managing technical challenges during a session was a good opportunity for clinicians to model positive problem-solving skills. All clinicians expressed the belief that technological problems are becoming less of a challenge, as families are becoming more technologically savvy and web-technology is advancing and becoming easier to navigate. However, clinicians felt that even with these advances, there would remain a subset of families who are uncomfortable with technology and would prefer face-to-face interventions.Clinician Perceptions of Families Who Benefit Most From TelepsychologyThere were a number of family factors that clinicians consistently identified as impacting a family’s likelihood of benefiting from an online delivery more than face-to-face. Families living in rural areas or those requiring transportation to a treatment facility were identified as a population most likely to benefit, as these families would struggle to access traditional in-office care. In addition, families with fewer resources or complicated schedules (e.g., working parents, having many children in the home, families managing many injury-related appointments, etc.) were also identified as more suited to online interventions. In contrast, families living in large households or those in homes where there is no suitable private space to participate in telepsychology sessions, may be less able to benefit from online interventions.Several clinicians noted that cognitive and attention issues, which are common following TBI, sometimes posed challenges during telepsychology sessions. Specifically, clinicians reported difficulty maintaining child attention and engagement. Expanding on this, clinicians felt that they needed to work harder to engage this population of patients, compared to those without attention issues. It should be noted that therapists also expressed that they would need to provide greater structure whether the session was delivered online or in-person; however, many of the strategies used to provide structure for children or adolescents with cognitive impairments and/or challenging behavior during in-person sessions needed to be adapted for use during telehealth. Adolescents who were quiet or reluctant to engage in treatment were also noted as posing challenges, although some clinicians noted that this would be true regardless of the treatment modality. Conversely, some clinicians thought that being online and in their home environment mitigated resistance to treatment for some adolescents. A number of clinicians noted similar challenges with attention and engagement during telepsychology sessions for parents as well.Clinician Perceptions of Clinician Qualities That Support Telepsychology DeliveryClinicians identified a number of clinician qualities which they believed facilitated online delivery, such as flexibility and comfort addressing disruptions. For example, clinicians reported that they needed to feel comfortable checking-in with families about distractions in the home that may be impacting the session (e.g., “Who is behind the computer?” or “What are you looking at?”). Clinicians also felt that an online delivery required clinicians to be comfortable taking a more didactic role with families and feeling at-ease “teaching families” about technological aspects of the intervention and trouble-shooting technological issues. Other clinician qualities that were suited to telepsychology delivery included feeling confidence in the efficacy of telepsychology interventions, being “able to read the situation,” and the ability to anticipate and problem-solve challenges that may arise. As for qualities of clinicians that would be less suited to deliver telepsychology treatments, a number of clinicians reported that telepsychology interventions could be less intimate than face-to-face sessions, and clinicians who valued the intimacy of being in the same physical space may be less suited to telepsychology.DiscussionThis mixed-methods study elucidated several advantages and disadvantages of utilizing telepsychology in comparison to face-to-face therapy for family-centered treatment of pediatric TBI from a clinician perspective. Overall, clinicians reported that telepsychology was superior to face-to-face therapy in terms of scheduling/attendance, understanding the family and home environments, and reducing behavioral health stigma. Although some clinicians commented that establishing therapeutic alliance via telepsychology could be challenging and require unique clinical skills, a majority of clinicians reported that establishing therapeutic alliance was equivalent between online and face-to-face sessions. This is consistent with past research with parents who have reported comparable levels of therapeutic alliance between web-delivered therapy and face-to-face therapy (Backhaus et al., 2012; Lingely-Pottie & McGrath, 2006). Clinicians reported several challenges with utilizing telepsychology; the most prominent including distractions and reading nonverbal cues. In addition, technological issues invariably arose from time to time. However, clinicians reported that problem-solving around these challenges was an effective opportunity to model and practice skills in vivo. Given that a subset of families were not native technology users and were provided with unfamiliar computer equipment to support their participation, these challenges are likely heightened relative to telepsychology with computer-savvy families.Clinicians also identified several clinician and family characteristics that facilitated telepsychology. Clinicians believed that families who lived in rural areas and with low resources were most likely to benefit, whereas families with more chaotic home environments without a private space for teleconferencing would be less likely to benefit. Previous studies suggest that rural families may be ideal candidates for telepsychology, particularly because of federal initiatives to provide inexpensive Internet access in these areas (Nelson & Bui, 2010). Additionally, low-income families, in contrast to high-income families, were most likely to benefit from an online parenting skills training intervention for pediatric TBI (Raj et al., 2015). However, lower income families and caregivers with a lower education were also less likely to complete a web-based family problem-solving intervention (Blaha et al., 2015). Taken together, these findings suggest that families in more unstable/chaotic homes who likely need the most help may have the greatest difficulty finding the time and resources to participate in both telepsychology and face-to-face interventions. In this regard, clinicians underscored the importance of being flexible in response to family challenges and being assertive in establishing appropriate boundaries.Clinician perceptions can better be understood in the context of the parent’s satisfaction with the videoconference-based treatment sessions. Previous reports suggest that satisfaction with the teletherapy was consistently high, albeit with a minority of families preferring face-to-face treatment. In the initial study (Wade, Carey, & Wolfe, 2006), 100% of parents rated the sessions as moderately to extremely helpful, with approximately 80% rating them as moderately to extremely helpful relative to face-to-face treatment. In a subsequent trial (Wade et al., 2014), 96% rated the videoconferences as helpful overall, with 85% rating them as very or extremely helpful. Similarly, parent satisfaction ratings for the parent-skills coaching intervention indicated that 87% found the sessions helpful relative to traditional in-person treatment (Antonini et al., 2012). Comparisons of adolescent satisfaction among those who participated with their parents versus independently (Wade et al., 2017) also noted high levels of satisfaction with the videoconferences among the adolescents themselves. Although not possible in the current project, future research would benefit from understanding the characteristics of families and children who preferred face-to-face treatment and the extent to which those characteristics dovetailed with the therapist’s perspectives.The current findings must be understood in the context of the study’s limitations, which include a relatively small sample of predominantly female clinicians who were specifically hired to conduct telepsychology, and thus may not be representative of the broader population of psychologists. It is possible that male clinicians may have yielded different insights regard the merits and disadvantages of telehealth with this population. Moreover, only six clinicians had the experience of delivering the same treatment in both face-to-face and online modalities, and the other clinicians relied on comparisons of the telehealth interventions to similar face-to-face treatments. Unfortunately, there are few randomized, controlled trials directly comparing telepsychology and face-to-face interventions for children and families, in comparison with the adult literature (Slone et al., 2012). Such head-to-head trials can ultimately identify who is most likely to benefit from each modality. We did not assess the therapist’s theoretical orientation and thus were unable to examine its influence on their perceptions of telehealth. Time since delivering the telehealth interventions varied considerably, and recall may have been biased by the passage of time. Additionally, improved teleconferencing capabilities may have mitigated some of the earlier concerns. Another limitation of this project includes notetaking, as opposed to audio recording the focus groups and interviews. Three separate individuals took notes during the focus groups as a means of reducing the limitation of this methodology. An additional limitation is that the focus groups and interviews were conducted by the psychologist who provided supervision for the telehealth treatments, which could have contributed to participant reluctance to express criticism of telepsychology. However, the therapist surveys were de-identified, and the request to complete the survey came from a coauthor (rather than the supervising psychologist). In addition, clinicians were encouraged to be as honest as possible regarding their experiences, and a team approach was undertaken to analyze the results. Findings from the therapist survey and focus group/interviews were consistent suggesting that the noted limitations had minimal impact on reported information. A number of the limitations of this study are reflective of the current status of telepsychology, in that this is a growing field. This study focused on the delivery of telepsychology to a distinct pediatric rehabilitation population, and studies with larger samples of psychologists and pediatric populations are needed.There are several challenges regarding continued research and dissemination in the area of telepsychology, including ethical considerations regarding confidentiality and online security, as well as ensuring participant’s safety regarding suicidality concerns/threats (see guidance in Henderson, Law, Palermo, & Eccleston, 2012). Additionally, there are special considerations when treating children and families with telepsychology, including modifications based on developmental status and the level of family involvement (Hilty et al., 2016). Finally, telepsychology poses several issues in terms of dissemination in typical clinical practice, including reimbursement and requirements regarding licensure in multiple states. Overall, clinicians in this study have expressed high satisfaction with the application of telepsychology with children and families, which indicates promise for the acceptance and dissemination of telepsychology more widely.In closing, findings from this study provide an important foundation for future investigations examining the merits of telepsychology versus traditional treatment for pediatric populations. Future research could examine cost effectiveness, as well as the role that clinician and patient perceptions of telepsychology play in adherence and attrition. It may also be helpful to direct future research toward a better description of the specific clinician factors and process variables (e.g., therapeutic alliance, adherence, etc.) that facilitate rapport during telepsychology treatment. This information would be helpful for the development of training for future clinicians utilizing telepsychology to optimize treatment efficacy. The use of information and communication technologies has emerged as the next big frontier in the efficient and effective delivery of health care. The term “telemedicine” has been adopted to describe health care delivery via technology (Wilson & Maeder, 2015), including in mental health treatment delivery, where it is typically known as telepsychology. Telepsychology, the delivery of psychological services via technology, is a broad field and encompasses various delivery modalities and formats (Nelson, Bui, & Velasquez, 2011). It needs to be distinguished from other forms of telemedicine, such as telepsychiatry, which further includes the delivery of psychopharmacological interventions via technology. The various delivery modalities and formats include the use of mobile phone technology (e.g., short message service or application-based interventions), telephone-delivered therapy, video teleconferencing, Internet-delivered text-based therapy or treatment programs, and other formats such as using social media or video games as adjuncts to therapy. While these delivery formats vary in their specifics, such as being self-directed, guided self-help, or real-time interaction with a specialist, all are accessible to individuals with Internet and/or phone service and suitable equipment.An important distinction in telepsychology is between “synchronous” and “asynchronous” delivery methods (Wilson & Maeder, 2015). Synchronous telepsychology refers to visual and/or auditory interactions between the client and provider that are in real time and is therefore the most similar delivery format to traditional in-person treatment (Osenbach, O’Brien, Mishkind, & Smolenski, 2013). Synchronous interventions include telephone or video teleconference (VTC)–delivered treatments and Internet-delivered text-based treatments that involve real-time text interactions (often referred to as “webchat”). Asynchronous telepsychology involves client–provider interactions that are not in real time and thus includes interventions such as automated Internet or computer-based interventions or e-mail interactions with providers (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, 2015).Telepsychology is of particular relevance in countries that face geographical challenges in delivering health care (Mehrotra et al., 2016). Research shows that increasing location remoteness was consistently associated with lower service use, and this relationship was particularly strong for specialist mental health interventions (Meadows, Enticott, Inder, Russell, & Gurr, 2015). There is even further restriction on the availability of providers who specialize in the treatment of particularly complex mental health conditions, such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), in regional and remote areas (Frueh, 2015; Riding-Malon & Werth, 2014). Research suggests that common barriers to seeking or receiving mental health treatment in rural or remote areas include concerns about stigma (Wrigley, Jackson, Judd, & Komiti, 2005), geographical isolation, difficulty accessing appropriate transport, concerns about the cost of treatment, and perceived time commitment (Handley et al., 2014). Certain populations of treatment seekers may be particularly vulnerable to perceptions of stigma relating to mental health, as well as being rurally located, such as veterans (Frueh, 2015). Accessing treatment via telepsychology may reduce concerns about stigma, with treatment available in the privacy of one’s own home, which provides flexibility and allows optimum use of client and therapist time (Rees & Haythornthwaite, 2004).Evidence for the effectiveness of telepsychology has been emerging over the past decade. Systematic reviews that have combined both types of telepsychology, that is, synchronous and nonsynchronous, indicate that telepsychology is generally effective (Backhaus et al., 2012). However, previous reviews have included several different telepsychology modalities, with Internet based, computer based, telephone based, and video based included, together without examining or commenting on the difference between synchronous and nonsynchronous treatments. Synchronous treatment is the most similar treatment to traditional psychological treatments and therefore seems to be the logical place to start, to further our understanding of telepsychology. Common types of synchronous treatment include telephone-delivered, VTC-delivered, and Internet-delivered text-based modalities. It has been noted in the literature that these heterogeneous modalities are commonly grouped together (Osenbach et al., 2013), but it is important to explore whether there is differential evidence supporting each of these modalities. There has been only one previous systematic literature review that has focused specifically on synchronous telepsychology for the treatment of depression (Osenbach et al., 2013), and it concluded that it was as effective as nontelehealth means in reducing depression symptoms. In comparison, no literature reviews have assessed the evidence in relation to synchronous telepsychology for other common mental health conditions such as anxiety, PTSD, and adjustment disorder. It is important to develop an understanding of how effective synchronous telepsychology is likely to be for these disorders, as people experiencing these disorders are often geographically isolated, experiencing stigma, or experiencing physical injury. Another common mental health problem, substance abuse, has been the subject of several telepsychology reviews over the past few years (e.g., Benavides-Vaello, Strode, & Sheeran, 2013; Young, 2012) and as such will not be examined in the current review.The aim of this review is to determine the efficacy of synchronous telepsychology for the treatment of three common mental health disorders (anxiety, PTSD, and adjustment disorder) that have not yet been investigated through systematic review, in addition to updating the literature on synchronous telepsychology for the treatment of depression beyond the findings from Osenbach and colleagues (Osenbach et al., 2013). Given that the study focus is heterogeneous in respect to modality (all forms of synchronous telepsychology) and disorder (anxiety, PTSD, adjustment disorder, and depression), and given that telepsychology is a rapidly developing field, it is well suited to a rapid evidence assessment (REA) approach as opposed to a systematic review.MethodThis study utilized an REA methodology, which is a rigorous process that avoids a number of the challenges that face a systematic review, such as the time and resource cost (Crawford, Boyd, Jain, Khorsan, & Jonas, 2015; Varker et al., 2015). The key limitations of an REA methodology come from the restricted search period and the exclusion of unpublished, difficult-to-obtain, and/or foreign language studies (Varker et al., 2015). The steps of an REA methodology are outlined below.Defining the QuestionThe first stage of the REA is defining the population, intervention, comparison, and outcome (PICO), in the same manner as a systematic review (Crawford et al., 2015). The population of interest was defined as adults with a diagnosis of depression, anxiety, PTSD, or adjustment disorder (ascertained by diagnosis or cutoff score on a validated measure). The intervention was defined as any psychological intervention delivered using synchronous telepsychology. The comparison included studies with treatment as usual (TAU), in-person treatments, or alternative telepsychology intervention comparisons. The outcome was defined as change in mental health symptom severity.Search StrategyMedline, PsycINFO, and the Cochrane library were searched for peer-reviewed literature published from January 2005 to July 2016. Each database was single searched using the title(s), abstract(s), MeSH terms, and keywords lists with search terms specific to telepsychology, common mental health conditions (i.e., depression, PTSD, adjustment disorder, and anxiety), and study type. The interventions that were searched for were those that are typically used in the treatment of depression, PTSD, adjustment disorder, and anxiety. The following search terms were used: “major depressive disorder” OR depression OR PTSD OR “posttraumatic stress” OR “post-traumatic stress” OR “traumatic stress” OR “stress disorder” OR anxiety OR “GAD” OR “generali*ed anxiety disorder” OR “anxiety disorder” OR phobia OR panic OR “adjustment disorder” AND “cognitive behavioral therapy” OR “cognitive behavioral therapy” OR CBT OR “cognitive processing therapy” OR “cognitive therapy” OR “dialectical behavior therapy” OR “dialectical behavior therapy” OR “behavior therapy” OR “behavior therapy” OR exposure OR “imaginal exposure” OR “in vivo exposure” OR “motivational interviewing” OR “acceptance and commitment therapy” OR “mindfulness” OR “schema therapy” OR “interpersonal therapy” OR EMDR OR “eye movement desensitization and reprocessing” OR “narrative therapy” OR “solution focused therapy” OR “solution focused therapy” OR “psychiatric consultation” OR therapy OR treatment OR counseling OR intervention AND telepsychology, OR telemedicine, OR e-health, OR telehealth, OR telephone, OR “mobile phone” OR video, OR videoconferencing, OR skype, OR face-time, OR Internet, OR online, OR web, OR web-based, OR Internet-based OR Internet-delivered OR telephone-based OR telephone-delivered OR web-delivered AND “systematic review” OR “meta-analysis” OR RCT OR “randomi*ed controlled trial” OR “control trial” OR “effectiveness trial” OR “control study” OR “clinical trial.”Study SelectionStudies were included if they were published in English; were peer-reviewed meta-analyses, systematic reviews, or randomized controlled trials (RCTs); involved adults (≥ 18 years of age); used psychological interventions delivered by synchronous telepsychology; included participants with a diagnosis or cutoff score indicating an anxiety disorder, major depressive disorder, PTSD, or adjustment disorder; and where trial outcomes included mental health symptom severity. Studies were excluded where asynchronous telepsychology modalities were used. One author (R.M.B.) initially screened the studies based on title and abstract and obtained the full-text papers that satisfied the inclusion criteria. The full-text papers were then screened for inclusion, with 10% of these randomly selected and checked by a second author (T.V.) for agreement. This meant that these papers were reviewed by the second author for eligibility as per the inclusion/exclusion criteria. Of the 10% checked by both reviewers, there was 100% interrater agreement. Any disagreements between reviewers would have been resolved by discussion or through adjudication by a third author (A.P.). If a meta-analysis selected for inclusion in the REA included a study that was also found as an independent article, then the individual study was not included or counted for the purposes of the current review and was only reported on as part of the meta-analysis.Quality AssessmentThe quality of included research studies was appraised using the criteria from the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) checklist (NHMRC, 1999), which considers the following four study features: the method of treatment assignment (i.e., correct blinding and randomization), control of selection bias (i.e., intention to treat and dropout rate), blinding of outcome assessor, and whether standardized assessment was used. The quality of systematic reviews and meta-analyses was assessed using NHMRC quality criteria (NHMRC, 2000), which consider the adequacy of the search strategy, appropriateness of the inclusion criteria, presence of quality assessment for individual studies, summary of the results of individual studies, and quantitative synthesis of results (where relevant). An overall rating of the quality of each study is provided in Table 2.TABLES AND FIGUREStable/figure thumbnailTable 2. Research Evaluating the Effectiveness of Synchronous Telemedicine-Delivered Psychological Interventions for Clients With High-Prevalence Mental Health ConditionsView larger image > in this page > in new window> Download slideThe results of these quality assessments were then used to inform the overall strength of the evidence.Ranking the Overall EvidenceThe evidence was evaluated using five criteria (Merlin, Weston, & Tooher, 2009): the strength of the evidence, in terms of the quality, quantity, and design of the included studies; the direction of the findings; the consistency of the findings across the included studies (including across a range of study populations and study designs); and the generalizability (of the body of evidence to the target population) and applicability of the findings to the population of interest, as defined by the PICO. Three independent raters (R.M.B., T.V., and J.W.) made ratings about the strength of the evidence, direction of the findings, consistency of the findings, generalizability, and applicability. Strength of the evidence was based on the following categories: high strength, where there is one or more systematic review or meta-analysis of RCTs with a low risk of bias (i.e., risk of there being a systematic error in the results, which can lead to underestimation or overestimation of the true intervention effect), or three or more RCTs with a low risk of bias; moderate strength, where there is one or two RCTs with a low risk of bias; and low strength, where there is one or more RCT with a high risk of bias. The direction of the findings was judged in terms of whether the weight of the evidence showed positive results, unclear results (i.e., no significant effects or mixed results), or negative results. Further details on the methods for making each of these judgments for each of the five criteria are detailed in Varker et al. (2015).The strength of the evidence, the direction of the findings, and the consistency of the findings reflect the internal validity of the findings in support of efficacy for an intervention. The last two components considered the external factors that may influence effectiveness. On the basis of these five factors, the total body of the evidence was then ranked into one of four categories: “Supported,” “Promising,” “Unknown,” and “Not Supported.” A ranking of “Supported” means that there is clear, consistent evidence of a beneficial effect with no evidence suggesting a negative or harmful effect. “Promising” means that the evidence is suggestive of a beneficial effect but further information is required. An “Unknown” ranking means that there is insufficient evidence of a beneficial effect and further research is required, and “Not Supported” means there is clear, consistent evidence of no effect or negative/harmful effect (Varker et al., 2015). Agreement on ranking was sought between three independent raters (T.V., R.M.B., and J.W.), with 100% interrater agreement found. Discrepancies between the raters would have been resolved through discussion.ResultsFigure 1TABLES AND FIGUREStable/figure thumbnailFigure 1. Flowchart of search for studies.View larger image > in this page > in new window> Download slideshows the yield at all stages of the review. After removing duplicate articles from an initial yield of 2,266 articles, 2,196 articles were screened on title and abstract and 206 were deemed eligible for full-text review. After the full-text review stage, 24 articles were deemed eligible for inclusion. Given the relatively small number of articles identified in the REA, the studies were grouped by telepsychology modality to provide the most meaningful results possible, regardless of the mental health disorder addressed in the study.Of the 24 articles included in the review, 8 studies (Brenes, Danhauer, Lyles, Hogan, & Miller, 2015; Dwight-Johnson et al., 2011; Gellis, Kenaley, & Have, 2014; Lovell et al., 2006; Ludman, Simon, Tutty, & Von Korff, 2007; Mohr, Carmody, Erickson, Jin, & Leader, 2011; Mohr et al., 2005, 2012) and 1 meta-analysis (Mohr, Vella, Hart, Heckman, & Simon, 2008) investigated the effectiveness of telephone-delivered interventions for depression; 10 studies (Acierno et al., 2016; Choi et al., 2014; Egede et al., 2015; Fortney et al., 2015; Morland et al., 2014, 2015; Stubbings, Rees, Roberts, & Kane, 2013; Vogel et al., 2014; Yuen et al., 2015; Ziemba et al., 2014) and 1 systematic review, which included 20 studies (Rees & Maclaine, 2015), investigated the effectiveness of VTC-delivered interventions for anxiety disorders; 2 further studies investigated Internet-delivered text-based interventions (Kessler et al., 2009; Kramer, Conijn, Oijevaar, & Riper, 2014); and 1 meta-analysis (Osenbach et al., 2013) investigated the effectiveness of multiple telepsychology modalities in the treatment of depression, while another meta-analysis investigated the effectiveness of multiple telepsychology modalities in the treatment of mood or functional mental health problems (Bee et al., 2008). The majority of the studies were conducted in the United States (n = 15), with studies also conducted in Europe (n = 4) and Australia (n = 1). A summary of the key characteristics of the included studies is described below and presented in Table 1.TABLES AND FIGUREStable/figure thumbnailTable 1. Characteristics of the Studies Investigating Synchronous Telepsychology InterventionsView larger image > in this page > in new window> Download slideThe overall findings for each intervention type are presented below and in Table 2.Telephone-Delivered InterventionsOverall, 11 studies investigated the effectiveness of telephone-delivered psychological interventions. Two meta-analyses looked at a range of telepsychology modalities, including telephone-delivered therapy (Bee et al., 2008; Osenbach et al., 2013), while a third meta-analysis looked specifically at telephone-delivered psychotherapy for depression (Mohr et al., 2008). Eight individual RCTs assessed telephone-delivered therapy for a range of disorders (i.e., generalized anxiety disorder, depression, and obsessive–compulsive disorder), with TAU comparisons (Dwight-Johnson et al., 2011; Gellis et al., 2014; Ludman et al., 2007; Mohr et al., 2011), in-person therapy comparisons (Lovell et al., 2006; Mohr et al., 2012), and telepsychology comparisons (Brenes et al., 2015; Mohr et al., 2005).Overall, the strength of the evidence for telephone-delivered therapy was rated as high, given that there were three meta-analyses, one of which had a low risk of bias (Bee et al., 2008) and two of which had a moderate risk of bias (Mohr et al., 2008; Osenbach et al., 2013), which had results supporting the use of telephone-delivered therapy. In addition to this, there were several other high-quality individual RCTs (Brenes et al., 2015; Dwight-Johnson et al., 2011; Gellis et al., 2014; Lovell et al., 2006; Ludman et al., 2007; Mohr et al., 2011, 2012). The direction of the evidence was judged to be positive, since all studies except for one reported that telephone-delivered therapy was as effective as standard in-person treatment or was better than TAU on a range of outcomes. One study did not find a significant difference in improvement between telephone-delivered cognitive–behavioral therapy (T-CBT) and TAU groups (Mohr et al., 2011), but given the strong positive weight of the rest of the evidence, this finding was judged not to be significant enough to lower the direction rating to “Unclear.” The consistency of the findings was judged to be moderate to high, as the majority of studies reported similar trends in the findings, with telephone-delivered therapy being as effective as TAU or standard in-person treatments. Specifically, T-CBT was found to be as effective as in-person treatments in noninferiority trials (i.e., trials comparing a novel treatment to an existing standard treatment) but was found to be superior to TAU. Given that the majority of studies were consistent in their findings, it was determined that these results are highly likely to be replicable. The generalizability of these studies was rated as moderate to high, as the studies included a range of disorders and samples. The applicability of these findings was judged to be high, as the treatments and delivery formats are highly relevant and applicable to a Western health system. Thus, given the high strength, positive direction, moderate to high consistency, moderate to high generalizability, and high applicability, the use of telephone-delivered telepsychology for clients with mental health conditions was ranked as “Supported.”Video Teleconference–Delivered InterventionsTwelve studies were identified that investigated the effectiveness of VTC-delivered interventions. One meta-analytic review looked at a range of telepsychology modalities, including VTC (Osenbach et al., 2013); one systematic review of VTC was identified (Rees & Maclaine, 2015) and 10 individual RCTs were also found, all of which used in-person intervention comparisons (Acierno et al., 2016; Choi et al., 2014; Egede et al., 2015; Fortney et al., 2015; Morland et al., 2014, 2015; Stubbings et al., 2013; Vogel et al., 2014; Yuen et al., 2015; Ziemba et al., 2014), other than one study that used a self-help book on evidence-based exposure and response prevention or waitlist comparison (Vogel et al., 2014).Overall, the strength of the evidence base for VTC-delivered telepsychology interventions was rated as high. This rating was primarily based on the presence of five high-quality RCTs with a low risk of bias (Acierno et al., 2016; Egede et al., 2015; Fortney et al., 2015; Morland et al., 2014; Yuen et al., 2015). The remaining RCTs in the VTC literature yield were rated as being at moderate or high risk of bias due to methodological issues such as small sample sizes, high dropouts (i.e., >25%), or lack of blinding of assessors (i.e., the assessors were aware of the treatment condition; Choi et al., 2014; Morland et al., 2015; Stubbings et al., 2013; Vogel et al., 2014; Ziemba et al., 2014). The direction of the evidence was rated as positive, with all studies finding that VTC-delivered therapy had results showing it was as effective as in-person therapy and one study finding that VTC-delivered therapy was superior to using a self-help book on evidence-based exposure and response prevention, as well as a waitlist control (Vogel et al., 2014). The consistency was rated as high, as all studies were consistent in their findings. The generalizability of the evidence base was rated as moderate to high, with the samples in the studies representative of adults with mental health conditions. Of note, however, six of the included studies focused solely on U.S. veteran populations. The applicability was also judged to be high as all treatments offered in the studies were considered to be available in a Western health system. Taken together, the high strength, positive direction, high consistency, moderate to high generalizability, and high applicability of the VTC studies led to the use of VTC-delivered telepsychology for clients with mental health conditions being ranked as “Supported.”Internet-Delivered Text-Based TreatmentsThree studies were identified that investigated the effectiveness of psychotherapy delivered via the Internet, in which therapists and clients communicated in real time through type-written responses (webchats). A meta-analysis by Bee and colleagues (2008) looked at psychotherapy delivered via a range of telepsychology modalities, including the Internet, and two individual RCTs assessed Internet-delivered text-based therapy for depression with TAU comparison groups (Kessler et al., 2009; Kramer, Conijn, Oijevaar, & Riper, 2014).The evidence base for Internet-delivered text-based therapy was judged to be of low strength, as it primarily consisted of two RCTs that were judged to be of low quality and have a high risk of selection bias (Kessler et al., 2009; Kramer et al., 2014). Although there was one meta-analysis, this study did not provide enough information to assess the individual merits of Internet-delivered text-based therapy and did not contribute to improving the strength of the evidence (Bee et al., 2008). The findings from the two RCTs were in the same positive direction, and the consistency was judged to be low to moderate as only two studies were included. The generalizability was judged to be moderate as one study used adults while the other used young people (i.e., where the mean age of the sample was 19.5 years). The applicability was rated as high, as the treatments were considered to be applicable and relevant to the Western health system, given the treatments are available in Western settings. Given the positive direction, low to moderate consistency, moderate generalizability, high applicability, but low strength of the evidence, the effectiveness of Internet-delivered text-based interventions for the treatment of mental health conditions, including depression, anxiety, PTSD, and adjustment disorder, was considered to be “Unknown.”DiscussionThe aim of this REA was to assess the effectiveness of telepsychology for clients with depression, anxiety, PTSD, or adjustment disorders. The reviewed literature suggests that there is a fast-growing evidence base in this area. The REA found that the evidence base is currently strongest and of the highest quality in the area of telephone-delivered and VTC-delivered interventions. Both telephone-delivered and VTC interventions met the criteria for a “Supported” treatment for mental health conditions, meaning that there is clear, consistent evidence of beneficial effect.The “Supported” rating for telephone-delivered interventions was informed by three meta-analyses (two of good quality with few risk of bias issues and one with moderate quality and bias issues) and several high-quality RCTs, all of which indicated that telephone-delivered interventions are significantly more effective than TAU and, in noninferiority trials, are as effective as standard in-person treatments. Of note, there was one high-quality RCT with U.S. veterans that did not find a significant difference in outcomes for T-CBT for depression in comparison to a TAU group (Mohr et al., 2011). The authors suggest that this may be evidence that more treatment resistant groups, such as veterans, may need more intensive approaches to treatment than telephone-delivered therapy. The authors also question whether there may be a publication bias in the literature for telephone-delivered interventions, in which null results are not being routinely published. Alternatively, it may be the case that there is generally very little research being conducted on telephone-delivered interventions. This needs to be noted in an appraisal of the evidence base for telephone-delivered interventions for mental health conditions, but given the specific population in the study (veterans) and the strong weight of evidence in contrast to the findings of this study, it was not considered to be enough to lower the overall “Supported” ranking for telephone-delivered interventions for mental health conditions.In the case of VTC-delivered interventions, the “Supported” rating was informed primarily by five high-quality RCTs with a low risk of bias. Notably, these five RCTs were all conducted in the United States with veteran populations (Acierno et al., 2016; Egede et al., 2015; Fortney et al., 2015; Morland et al., 2014; Yuen et al., 2015). Veterans are a specific population who may benefit from VTC interventions, given that they are a group with particularly high rates of mental health conditions (Ikin et al., 2004; Searle, Lawrence-Wood, Saccone, & McFarlane, 2013) and with documented barriers to accessing appropriate evidence-based treatments (Brooks et al., 2012). This is likely to be the reason for a proliferation of recent research into telepsychology-delivered interventions in veteran populations particularly.The evidence for Internet-delivered text-based synchronous interventions for mental health conditions was limited and primarily consisted of two RCTs judged to be of only moderate quality due to a lack of control of selection bias (Kessler et al., 2009; Kramer et al., 2014). These RCTs suggested that Internet-delivered text-based synchronous interventions (by webchat) were superior to waitlist control, specifically in treating depression. Given the lack of high-quality evidence in this area, the use of Internet-delivered text-based synchronous interventions for mental health conditions was ranked as “Unknown,” indicating that there is insufficient evidence of a beneficial effect, and further methodologically rigorous research across different populations and mental health conditions is needed.The technology involved in telepsychology interventions is relatively new, particularly in the case of VTC-delivered interventions. This is reflected in the fact that all of the VTC studies were conducted after 2013, with the more than half having been published in the last year. It is therefore likely that the evidence base for VTC interventions in particular will continue to grow at a rapid rate in the coming years.Limitations and Future DirectionsThe findings must be considered alongside the limitations of an REA. The omission of potentially important papers, including those that were unpublished, not in English, and published prior to 2005, limits the comprehensiveness of an REA (Varker et al., 2015). The evaluations of the evidence were not as exhaustive as in a systematic review or meta-analysis methodology, and the study results were not synthesized in a statistical way. The REA focused specifically on adults, meaning the relevance of these findings to children and adolescents is unknown. The majority of the included studies were conducted in Western settings, which limits the generalizability to non-Western countries. In addition, the scope of this review was guided by the funders of the research and therefore limited to anxiety, depression, PTSD, and adjustment disorder. As such, several other important psychiatric disorders were not investigated. Finally, due to the fact that this was an REA, data from the studies included in this review were not meta-analyzed. This is a limitation of the REA methodology, in comparison to systematic reviews that often include meta-analysis.An important direction for future research is to repeat and extend the current research, with the inclusion of meta-analysis. It will be important to identify which populations benefit most from telepsychology and to also identify whether adverse effects are observed in any populations. In addition, the current review revealed that relatively few RCTs have been conducted on Internet-delivered text-based interventions, and those that have been done have had methodological limitations. Therefore, there is a need for further well-designed RCTs to examine the efficacy of Internet-delivered text-based interventions.ConclusionsBased on the findings of this REA, both telephone- and VTC-delivered interventions for mental health conditions are “Supported” by the current available evidence. Synchronous Internet-delivered text-based interventions require further methodologically rigorous RCTs and reviews in order to provide more robust data on their effectiveness. The potential for telepsychology to overcome common barriers to treatment access and its apparent efficacy and equivalence to in-person treatments therefore suggests that it is a promising delivery method for increasing the reach of evidence-based psychological interventions. This may be of particular use for those in rural and remote communities who have significant issues with access to evidence-based psychological therapies. Given that these are relatively new technologies, which are increasing in their mass availability, it will also be important to watch the evidence in this area over the next 5–10 years. Behavioral health (BH) problems among children and adolescents are common, with at least one in five suffering from a disorder and others at risk (Patel, Flisher, Hetrick, & McGorry, 2007). Many e-BH care options like websites, chat groups, apps, texts, and wearable sensors are being used with in-person and video telebehavioral health (TBH; Hilty, Chan, Torous, Mahautmr, & Mucic, 2015; Hilty, Rabinowitz, et al., 2018; Odgers & Jensen, 2020; Russell & Gajos, 2020; Sequeira et al., 2020; Odgers & Jensen, 2020). Treatments that rely less on specialized human resources like mobile health, if feasible and effective, could create scalable approaches at a population level (World Health Organization, 2017), particularly in collaboration with pediatricians/primary care providers (PCPs).Video adult studies and guidelines (American Telemedicine Association [ATA], 2009, 2013; Hilty, Ferrer, et al., 2013; Hubley, Lynch, Schneck, Thomas, & Shore, 2016) preceded child and adolescent developments related to assessment, management, collaborative care and guidelines (ATA, 2017; Coffey, Vanderlip, & Sarvet, 2017; Myers, Vander Stoep, Zhou, McCarty, & Katon, 2015; Nelson & Patton, 2016; Nelson & Sharp, 2016). Mobile health, social media, and wearable sensors are effectively used to assess and treat patients of all ages (Aboujaoude & Salame, 2016; Archangeli, Marti, Wobga-Pasiah, & Zima, 2017; Fedele, Cushing, Fritz, Amaro, & Ortega, 2017; Russell & Gajos, 2020; Sequeira et al., 2020). Child and adolescent patients, parents, and families have played an instrumental role in many ways: development and pretesting technology (Hetrick et al., 2018; Whittaker et al., 2008); ensuring wearable sensors really work day-to-day (e.g., water or contact sports); and providing feedback to for visuals, chat options, and communication methods with clinicians (Anderson et al., 2018; Thompson, Goodwin, Ojeda, Morris, & Fairman, 2020; Russell & Gajos, 2020).Competencies in information technology were suggested as part of health care reform in 2003 (National Academy of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine 2020). Most of the competency work has been done for video in adults, though it may apply to children and adolescents (Hilty et al., 2015; Hilty, Maheu, et al., 2018; Maheu et al., 2020). Social media (Hilty, Zalpuri, et al., 2018), mobile health (Hilty, Chan, Torous, Luo, & Boland, 2020), wearable sensors (Hilty, Armstrong, Luxton, Gentry, & Krupinski, 2020), and asynchronous (Hilty, Torous, et al., 2020) competencies have also been done for adults, though they may apply more to children and adolescents. There are no specific telecompetencies for children, adolescents and families, but there are good telepsychiatry toolkits (American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry [AACAP] Committee on, Telepsychiatry and AACAP Committee on Quality Issues, 2017; American Psychiatric Association-AACAP, 2020).The overarching goal is to use identify clinician behaviors (i.e., skills or competencies) to ensure quality of care for child and adolescent patients and further training. We report general findings applicable to all ages, as some findings overlap for children, adolescents, young adults, and adults, but point out meaningful distinctions between the groups.MethodApproachThe literature key word search was conducted from January 2000 to March 2020. The philosophical approach to the search was done according to the original six-stage process (Arksey & O’Malley, 2005) and updated modifications (Levac, Colquhoun, & O’Brien, 2010) for scoping reviews.The Research QuestionThe question that guided the review was, “What skills are needed for clinicians and trainees to provide quality care using asynchronous technologies for children and adolescents, and how can they be made measurable to implement, teach and evaluate?” Within that question, there are other questions including (a) What steps have researchers, organizations and others taken to establish technological competencies, specifically, asynchronous competencies? (b) How can asynchronous competencies be organized in a competency-based education framework, in terms of components, concepts, and processes? (c) What administrative approaches can facilitate asynchronous clinical care, education/training, and evaluation in order for positive implementation and sustainability?Identifying Relevant Studies: The Search StrategyA literature key word search from January 2000 to March, 2020 used the following databases: Pubmed/Medline, APA PsycNET, PsycINFO, Embase, Web of Science, Scopus, and Social Sciences Citation Index. The initial literature search targeted four concept areas related to the behavioral health care of children and adolescents: (a) competencies (behavior, cognition, cognitive, curriculum, education, framework, learner, pedagogy, skill, training, Milestones); (b) asynchronous technologies (app, device, eConsult, e-consult, e-mail, mobile, monitoring, sensor, social media, store-and-forward, text, wearable); (c) synchronous telepsychiatry, telebehavioral or telemental health (video, web-based, Internet; since asynchronous technologies often added); and (d) clinical therapeutic relationship (behavior, boundaries, care, communication, connect, engagement, empathy, family, intimacy, outcome, parent, play, psychotherapy, system, therapeutic, therapy, training, trust, youth). Studies that focused predominantly on interventions for parents, substance use, well-being/prevention, and pregnant/parenting themes were not included.Study SelectionAn iterative process was used to search the literature, refine the search strategy, and review articles for study inclusion. Two authors (DH, JT) independently, in parallel, screened the potentially relevant studies based on titles and abstracts. Full-text articles were reviewed using inclusion criteria: key words used from concept area 1 (competencies) and 2 (asynchronous telehealth) used in combination with 3 (telehealth mode) or 4 (clinical). Exclusion criteria are shown in Figure 1.TABLES AND FIGUREStable/figure thumbnailFigure 1. Search flow chart: Diagram of studies and other papers reviewed.View larger image > in this page > in new window> Download slideWhen disagreements on study inclusion occurred, a third reviewer (IZ) determined the outcome.Charting the DataA data-charting form was not developed and used, but notes were organized and a descriptive/narrative analytical method was used to summarize the process and content information from the articles and discussions with experts, in an effort to chart and summarize complex concepts.Analysis, Reporting, and Considering the Meaning of the FindingsBecause there were so few articles, findings were reported individually and excerpts from published framework tables—mostly for adult care—were organized into a table and contextualized inclusively for adolescent, children and families, if applicable. The Accreditation Council of Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) Milestone framework was selected, as it is well known across medicine and by some BH professions (ACGME, 2013).Consultation for Expert OpinionExpert option was solicited to review preliminary findings and suggest changes by (a) a series of medical educator conference calls focused on competencies, based on previous work (Hilty, Crawford, et al., 2015; Zalpuri et al., 2018); (b) regular conference calls with clinicians and researchers of international organizations (e.g., ATA, American Psychiatric Association, Coalition for Technology in Behavioral Science [CTiBS]); (c) outreach to representatives of BH professions, based on past consensus processes (Maheu, Drude, Hertlein, & Hilty, 2018); and (d) discussions with individuals referred by the conference calls. Participants included chairs, deans, course/program directors, national society executive directors, officers, and journal editors.ResultsLiteratureFigure 1 shows that from a total of 5,877 potential references, two authors (DH, JT) found 5,567 eligible for title and abstract review and found 519 articles eligible for full text review as directly relevant to the concept areas in combination. Of the eligible studies, 409 were excluded, leaving a total of 110 articles.Overview of Synchronous and Asynchronous Technologies and WorkflowClinical care in-person, by video, telephone and via asynchronous technologies have similarities and differences (Hilty, Parish et al., 2020; Hilty, Torous, et al., 2020; Hilty, Maheu, Drude, & Hertlein, 2018; Lyneham & Rapee, 2005; Yellowlees et al., 2018). Technology may change the nature of interaction for participants in terms of exchange of information, clarity, responsiveness and comfort, depending on their digital literacy (e.g., digital natives and immigrants; ATA, 2017; American Psychiatric Association and American Telemedicine Association, 2018; Hilty et al., 2013; Myers & Turvey, 2013; Maheu et al., 2018; Wang, Myers, & Sundaram, 2013). Technology integration into workflow (e.g., clinic, communication, policy, procedures) takes effort to ensure quality and medico-legal issues are addressed (see Table 1;TABLES AND FIGUREStable/figure thumbnailTable 1. A Comparison of Synchronous and Asynchronous Care Dimensions: Clinical, Technical, and Administrative WorkflowView larger image > in this page > in new window> Download slideHilty, Torous, et al., 2020). Financial, policy, and other mandates have yet to be sorted (e.g., managing emergencies; Edwards-Stewart, Alexander, Armstrong, Hoyt, & O’Donohue, 2019; Hilty, Torous, et al., 2020).Behavioral Health Profession and International Telemedicine and Country Competencies, Position Statements, and Guidelines on Asynchronous TechnologiesA comparison of BH professions’ best practices, guidelines, and position statements for clinicians to adjust to video and asynchronous technologies shows more work on adult rather than child and adolescent care (see Table 2).TABLES AND FIGUREStable/figure thumbnailTable 2.

Most guidelines focus on video and sparingly mention e-mail, e-consultation, social media or texting (ATA, 2009, 2013; American Psychiatric Association and American Telemedicine Association, 2018; Hilty, Crawford, et al., 2015; Hilty, Maheu, et al., 2018; Maheu et al., 2018, 2020).The U.S. AACAP (2017), the ATA Child and Adolescent Telemental Health Guideline (2017) and AACAP-American Psychiatric Association (2019) specifically focus on child and adolescent video; the ATA Guideline more purposely discussed apps, asynchronous, e-mail, e-consultation, monitoring, social media, text, and wearables (ATA, 2017). A more substantial discussion of asynchronous technology began in the U.S. with competencies published for social media (Hilty, Zalpuri, et al., 2018; Zalpuri et al., 2018), mobile health (Hilty, Chan, Torous, Luo, & Boland, 2019a; 2019b, 2020), and asynchronous care (Hilty, Torous, et al., 2020).Specific Asynchronous Technology ModesE-mail, text, and appse-Mail interviewing with young populations is cost-effective, offers flexibility, provides a transcript for analysis, and offers time to reflect on questions, compose answers, and respond at leisure from home surroundings (Cleary & Walter, 2011). Text-based mobile health interventions are used for reminders, information, supportive messages, and self-monitoring (Berrouiguet, Baca-García, Brandt, Walter, & Courtet, 2016; Senanayake et al., 2019). Keyboard characters and emoticons may enrich communication and comprehension (Aldunate & González-Ibáñez, 2017), though they are not always used in a standard way, particularly across cultures (Hilty, Randhawa, et al., 2020). Apps are used for health, well-being, and clinical topics like homelessness, suicide, substance use (Bry, Chou, Miguel, & Comer, 2018; Glover et al., 2019; Perry, Werner-Seidler, Calear, & Christensen, 2016; Pisani et al., 2018; Stoll, Pina, Gary, & Amresh, 2017; Senanayake et al., 2019; Wyman et al., 2010). Youth and their parents/guardians often need guidance how to check the quality of apps (i.e., evidence-based; Grist, Porter, & Stallard, 2017). Challenges of these technologies include verification of self-report, potentially compromised rapport, technical glitches, biased samples, quality control, confidentiality, and security (Hilty, Randhawa, et al., 2020).Sensors and wearablesStudies of biobehavioral sensing, machine learning, and wearable technologies in the form of patches or bandages, wristbands, rings, shirts, smartwatches, and smart glasses show largely positive outcomes (Mackintosh et al., 2019; Sequeira et al., 2020), including for cognitive–behavioral therapy to treat depression and anxiety, socialization for autism, and aggression with autism (Goodwin, Mazefsky, Ioannidis, Erdogmus, & Siegel, 2019; Hollis, Falconer, Martin, Whittington, Stockton, Glazebrook, & Davies, 2017; Voss et al., 2019). Wearable sensors facilitate ecological momentary assessment (EMA) and EM intervention (EMI; Hollis et al., 2017; Russell & Gajos, 2020). Competencies for wearable sensors have been suggested to assess patient needs, facilitate interactivity (e.g., chat, feedback), and use decision support within the EHR (Hilty, Armstrong, et al., 2020).e-consultatione-Consultation (i.e., e-consult or eConsult) generally involves a pediatrician/PCP referral for a consultation related to questions outside of their expertise (Hilty, Ingraham, Yang, & Anders, 2004; Hilty et al., 2013; Liddy, Drosinis, & Keely, 2016; Sarvet et al., 2010; Yellowlees, Hilty, Marks, Neufeld, & Bourgeois, 2008). Results also showed consultants have a short response time than for in-person or video options (i.e., a few days rather than weeks or months), high satisfaction by users with ease of completion, and a reduced need for in-person and video visits.Store-and-forward/asynchronous technologyStore-and-forward technologies have the specialist interpret an image, video (e.g., asynchronous telepsychiatry) or other data, while incorporating clinical history, to give the pediatrician/PCP a plan to implement (Hilty, Torous, et al., 2020; Yellowlees et al., 2018). This could also be employed for collaborative, stepped, and integrated care e.g., train a pediatrician/PCP or other team member to do the semistructured interview (Hilty, Torous, et al., 2020).Opportunities and Challenges With Asynchronous TechnologiesShifts in moving from in-person and synchronous care to asynchronous careSeveral paradigm shifts are happening with technology-based care. One shift is integrating technology into traditional health care or adapting that care to technology. Social media is integral to adolescents and young adults and therefore part of care (Hilty, Zalpuri, et al., 2018; Zalpuri et al., 2018), so the clinician needs to systematically screen technology use and for what purpose(s; e.g., entertainment, health care, BH), as well as exposure to risks (e.g., self-disclosure, cyberbullying, privacy; Hilty et al., 2019b; Joshi, Stubbe, Li, & Hilty, 2019; Krishna, 2017; Parish & Yellowlees, 2014).Another shift is that technology outside the office creates a new, previously impossible, sense of continuity, connection, and ease of communication—and this affect the therapeutic frame, expectations, boundaries, and trust (Hilty, Randhawa, et al., 2020). Text-based communication has a sense of immediacy and interaction that builds “trust,” while transcending time and space, but there may be negative consequences (Hilty, Randhawa, et al., 2020). Online communication may improve patient satisfaction (e.g., better access), and online (only) therapeutic modalities have reasonable engagement (Krishna, 2017).A third shift is how to integrate mobile health, text, sensors, social media, and other technologies into clinical workflow—into the treatment plan and in conjunction with in-person care. In-time data collection can be used to alert a patient or clinician to take action, based on more valid, reliable and meaningful data (Chan, Li, Torous, Gratzer, & Yellowlees, 2018; Grist, Cliffe, Denne, Croker, & Stallard, 2018; Kenny, Dooley, & Fitzgerald, 2016). Care is need to ensure therapeutic rapport, avoid miscommunications and misunderstandings, and prevent problems with privacy and boundaries (e.g., no after-hours texting, not using mobile phone for professional care).Health System and Institutional Approaches to Technology CompetenciesOverviewCompetency-based education focuses on clinical skill development in addition to knowledge acquisition (Iobst et al., 2010; Northey & Gehart, 2019). Clinical informatics Milestones were suggested for the EHR, data use (e.g., safety, quality, privacy), and clinical decision support (Hersh et al., 2014). These were followed by adult competency sets for telepsychiatry (Hilty, Crawford, et al., 2015; Hilty, Maheu, et al., 2018), TBH (Maheu et al., 2018, 2020), social media (2018; Hilty, Zalpuri, et al., 2018; Zalpuri et al., 2018), mobile health (Hilty et al., 2019a; 2019b, 2020), wearable sensors (Hilty, Armstrong, et al., 2020), and asynchronous care (Hilty, Torous, et al., 2020). Most of these sets used the ACGME domains (ACGME, 2013) and included suggestions for training, faculty development, and institutional change.Synchronous video is gradually being integrated into clinical care and curricula through seminar, supervision, and rotations in the BH professions (Hilty, Unützer, et al., 2019). A delicate component of this is psychotherapy as part of clinical care and training (i.e., online, e- or otherwise framed; Caldwell, Bischoff, Derrig-Palumbo, & Liebert, 2017; Nelson & Patton, 2016; Pickens, Morris, & Johnson, 2019). Mobile health, social media, and informatics practice require more substantial planning due to clinical decision support, technology selection, and workflow, particularly for families (Wrape & McGinn, 2019; Hilty, Torous, et al., 2020). Clinicians need to plan to review data or be prompted, and then adjust treatment plans “in time” rather than waiting until the next in-person or video visit.The new asynchronous competencies for behavioral health for trainingThis review uses the six ACGME domains (ACGME, 2013), which are Patient Care, Medical Knowledge, System-Based Practice, Professionalism, Practice-Based Learning and Improvement, and Interpersonal and Communication Skills. The authors used subdomain headings applicable across BH professions (Hilty, Maheu, et al., 2018; Maheu et al., 2020), and shifted content to a 3-level learner system (i.e., Beginner, Competent/Proficient and Expert; Hilty, Crawford, et al., 2015) from a variety of levels reported in the literature (ACGME, 2013; Dreyfus & Dreyfus, 1980).The competencies for asynchronous technology (see Table 3),TABLES AND FIGUREStable/figure thumbnailTable 3.

Clinical and Training Examples of the Asynchronous Competencies (Format: Domain and Subdomain of Clinical Care [Table 3], and Domain and Subdomain of Training [Table 4] If Applicable)View larger image > in this page > in new window> Download slideare suggested for programs to address the specific asynchronous competencies. Training subdomains are: Didactic Teaching; Case-based Learning; Clinical Care with Patients; Professionalism, Supervision, and Practice-based Improvement and Learning; Systems-based Practice, Quality Improvement (QI), Evaluation and Research; and Role as an Educator. Systematic curricular planning and evaluation can link patient, learner, and teaching outcomes (i.e., skill, attitude and/or knowledge; Pratt & Collins, 1998; Kern, Thomas, & Hughes, 2009; Kirkpatrick & Kirkpatrick, 2009).Institutional competenciesCompetencies are suggested to integrate video and other technologies: 1) assess readiness; 2) create/hardwire the culture; 3) write policies and procedures; 4) establish the curriculum and competencies; 5) train learners and faculty; and 6) evaluate/manage change (Hilty, Unützer, et al., 2019). For integrating asynchronous technologies, focus areas are: Patient-Centered Care; Evaluation and Outcomes; Roles/Needs of Participants (e.g., Trainees, Faculty, Teams, Professions); Teams, Professions, and Systems Within Institutions; and the Academic Health Center Institutional Structure, Process, and Administration (Hilty, Torous, et al., 2020).DiscussionWhen used to their best capacity, asynchronous technologies improve access, reduce costs, facilitate teamwork, and include family and caregivers via new workflows (Fedele et al., 2017; Hilty, Sunderji, Suo, Chan, & McCarron, 2018; Hilty, Unützer, et al., 2019; Hilty, Torous, et al., 2020; Raney, Bergman, Torous, & Hasselberg, 2017). This supports patient-centered care, participatory medicine, and quality care (Epstein & Hundert, 2002; Frydman, 2009). Clinician competencies and child and adolescent codesign of technologies could improve real-world practice and maximize uptake (Hetrick et al., 2018; Hilty, Chan, et al., 2020; Hilty, Torous, et al., 2020).Technology literacy needs to be validly, reliably, systematically assessed as part of the context of the family’s overall health (Sefton-Green, Marsh, Erstad, & Flewitt, 2016; Terras & Ramsay, 2016). Research is also needed about the psychology of participants’ emergent behaviors and the influential role of context on use. Clinicians and family have significant professional, social, ethical, and legal responsibilities to ensure children and adolescents use technologies safely in this era of digital marketing (e.g., Google Play Store, Apple Store; Wang et al., 2014; Archangeli et al., 2017; Bry et al., 2018; Extremera, Quintana-Orts, Sánchez-Álvarez, & Rey, 2019; Hilty, Torous, et al., 2020; Torous & Roberts, 2017). Faculty supervisors and leaders also have to ensure the delivery of compassionate care with technology (Hilty, Randhawa, et al., 2020; Kemp et al., 2020).Academic organizations face many opportunities and challenges related to clinical care, training, research, and administration (Bowe, Lahey, Kegan, & Armstrong, 2003; Hilty, Liu, Stubbe, & Teshima, 2019). An information technology-business-medicine understanding or framework has been proposed to organize/integrate rather than append information technology to existing systems (Hilty, Uno, Chan, Torous, & Boland, 2019; Hilty, Unützer, et al., 2019; Ray, Muhanna, & Barney, 2007). Institutional competencies and new partnerships with informatics could consolidate missions around competencies (Hilty, Torous, et al., 2020). Organizations may have to emphasize effectiveness, implementation, mixed methods research as much or more than randomized controlled trials (Archangeli et al., 2017; Hilty et al., 2013; Marcolino, Alkmim, Pessoa, Maia, & Cardoso, 2019; Proctor et al., 2011). Mobile health and wearable sensors can help with EMA and EMI in daily life (Odgers & Jensen, 2020; Russell & Gajos, 2020).There are limitations to this article. First, the scoping review process was limited in terms of explicit processes for replicability (e.g., data-charting form to extract data, systematic steps for the analysis phase) and quality of analysis (thematic and numerical; Levac et al., 2010). It could have benefitted from a broader interprofessional team and input across child and adolescent BH organizations. Second, each of the technologies is unique, so greater depth of analysis is needed to determine the “what, when, why and how” they work. Third, institutions differ, and one approach may not fit all. Fourth, this set of competencies must be more clearly defined (i.e., measurable) to implement and evaluate across professions—in conjunction with faculty development and building of a positive e-culture for participants to succeed.ConclusionsAs asynchronous technologies like text, apps, sensors, e-mail, e-consultation, and store-and-forward telehealth are integrated into health care, steps are needed to ensure quality care, clinicians’ skills, and outcomes in line with in-person and synchronous telepsychiatric care. Clinician skillsets (i.e., competencies) for in-person, synchronous and asynchronous technologies overlap, but since the latter has many different components, training could be useful to build a positive e-culture for clinicians, trainees and leaders. Effectiveness and implementation science research—with patient input—is needed to increase the evidence base and usability of mobile health options. 1 | INTRODUCTIONTelemental health, in which mental health care is provided from a distance, encompasses a broad range of practices, including the use of videoconferencing, e-mail, remote monitoring devices, and smartphone applications (Grady et al., 2011; Hailey, Roine, & Ohinmaa, 2008). Telemental health conducted via videoconferencing, referred to hereafter as TMH-V, provides real-time mental health care directly to patients and is rapidly expanding across private and publicly funded health-care systems worldwide (Australian Government Department of Health, 2018; Godleski, Darkins, & Peters, 2012; Lacktman & Rosen, 2017; O'Gorman, Hogenbirk, & Warry, 2015). Psychotherapy, medication management, and assessment services can be delivered via TMH-V to patients located at remote clinics or directly to patients' homes, improving access to care by reducing travel time and costs and providing specialty services to underserved locations (Fletcher et al., 2018; Hubley, Lynch, Schneck, Thomas, & Shore, 2016). TMH-V has shown robust clinical effectiveness in multiple trials, and outcomes were demonstrated as noninferior to in-person care in several studies (Bashshur, Shannon, Bashshur, & Yellowlees, 2016; Hilty et al., 2013; Hubley et al., 2016). Patients have reported high satisfaction with TMH-V overall, describing it as effective and efficient (Kruse et al., 2017).The effectiveness and patient-level acceptance of TMH-V have been well-documented, and there is a growing body of literature examining characteristics of mental health providers using this technology in practice (Glueckauf et al., 2018). However, there has yet to be a systematic review of providers' attitudes toward TMH-V. This represents a critical gap in the literature, given that providers are often the gatekeepers of health-care innovations (Brooks, Turvey, & Augusterfer, 2013; Whitten & Mackert, 2005). If providers do not support the use of TMH-V, uptake may stagnate at the clinic level and patients may be unable to access TMH-V care. TMH-V has the potential to both benefit and inconvenience providers, and these factors may differentially impact providers' attitudes. For example, while TMH-V may make care more efficient and accessible and can increase providers' flexibility, it may also present new challenges with regard to navigating new technologies, coordinating care, scheduling appointments, and developing rapport with patients (Brooks et al., 2013).It is therefore important to examine factors contributing to providers' attitudes toward TMH-V. The unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT; Venkatesh, Morris, Davis, & Davis, 2003) is a comprehensive framework that identifies four primary constructs underlying individuals' acceptance of a technological innovation: performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, and facilitating conditions. Performance expectancy is the extent to which an individual believes that an innovation will be useful and will have a relative advantage over other systems. According to the UTAUT, performance expectancy is the strongest predictor of intention to use a technology. Effort expectancy is defined as the perceived ease of using a given innovation. Social influence refers to perceptions that important people, such as organizational leadership, want the individual to use a new technology, and would view the individual positively for doing so. Facilitating conditions are defined as the perceived level of organizational and technical infrastructure in place to support use of the technology. The UTAUT posits that these four constructs can be moderated to varying extents by user age, gender, and experience using the technology, as well as the degree of voluntariness of adopting the innovation.The current systematic review had three primary aims. The first was to assess the extent to which providers' overall attitudes toward TMH-V were positive or negative. The second aim was to situate these findings within the key constructs outlined in the UTAUT, namely the extent to which TMH-V was found to be useful, easy to use, encouraged by organizational leaders, and supported by necessary infrastructure. The third aim was to examine potential influences of provider age, gender, experience with TMH-V, and voluntariness of use on attitudes toward this innovation.2 | METHODSWe conducted a comprehensive review of the English-language, peer-reviewed literature on providers' attitudes toward TMH-V, published between January 2000 and June 2019 within three databases: PubMed, CINAHL, and Embase. Each subsequent database search filtered out results from the previous databases to prevent duplicates. Our initial search strategy required articles to contain a term pertaining to TMH-V as well as a term referring to providers or attitudes/experiences within their titles and/or abstracts. The complete list of searched terms is as follows (with asterisks indicating that any words beginning with that string of letters were included):TMH-V terms: telemental health, tele-mental health, telepsychiatry, telepsychotherapy, telepsychology, teletherapy, e-therapy, online therapy, online counseling, OR [(telehealth, telemedicine, telecare, video*, communication tech*) AND (psych*, mental*)]Provider terms: provider*, clinician*, psychiatrist*, psychologist*, stakeholder*, nurse*, professional*, physician*, social work*, personnel*Attitude terms: attitude*, perception*, experience*, interest*, opinion*, view*, utilization, satisfactionThe first author screened the titles and abstracts of the articles resulting from this search and identified those appropriate for full-text review. To meet criteria for inclusion with this review, articles were required to include the following:Information regarding providers' attitudes toward or experiences using TMH-V to provide direct, real-time clinical care to patients. Consulting with another provider by videoconference, or the use of alternative technologies such as secure messaging, store and forward communications, or web-based treatment protocols did not qualify.Information from the perspective of the provider who conducted/would be conducting the TMH-V session with the patient versus from a primary care or emergency room doctor requesting a TMH-V consult.Qualitative and/or quantitative data collected using an explicitly identified measure, such as a survey or semi-structured interview. Articles that did not indicate and describe the measure used to collect their data were excluded.At least four providers meeting the above criteria were sampled. Providers could be of varying disciplines. This number was chosen in an attempt to achieve balance between including as many high-quality studies as possible, while also helping ensure that the interpretations of findings were reasonably generalizable to the broader population of mental health providers.2.1 | ReliabilityThe first author identified a subset of 10 articles from within the 86 identified for full-text review, some of which the first author had determined to meet inclusion criteria, others of which were ultimately excluded. These articles were independently scored as eligible or ineligible by co-authors CJM and MSB. Fleiss's kappa for the three raters within this subset of manuscripts was .829, indicating excellent interrater reliability. SLC, CJM, and MSB then met for a consensus meeting in which the inclusion/exclusion of all 86 articles was discussed, guided by a document compiled by SLC including detailed summaries of the articles' study designs, participants, and findings. The group reached consensus on the 38 articles included in the final sample.2.2 | Analytic approachThe following information was reported for each included study: the number, discipline, and extent of TMH-V experience of providers sampled, the type of services provided through TMH-V, characteristics of the patient population, the location at which patients received TMH-V care, the measures used to assess providers' attitudes, and a brief summary of main findings. TMH-V experience was defined as whether or not providers had ever conducted a TMH-V session with a patient. Risk for selection bias, performance bias, detection bias, attrition bias, and selective reporting bias was assessed for all studies according to Cochrane Collaboration guidelines (Higgins & Green, 2011).At the broadest level, it was determined whether providers' overall attitudes toward TMH-V were reported as primarily positive or negative within each study, when that information was available. Each article was then coded for the presence of the four primary UTAUT constructs within provider attitude data: Performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, facilitating conditions, and subconstructs were identified. The frequency with which subconstructs were endorsed, and the percentage of all articles that included each subconstruct were then calculated, and findings were summarized across articles. Next, based on the UTAUT model, the potential moderating role of gender, age, experience, and voluntariness of use was considered within provider attitude data. Articles were coded as to whether they presented findings involving any of these moderators. Experience was the only moderator discussed across multiple articles; these results were summarized across articles. Additional distinctions in providers' attitudes not encompassed in the above sections were then coded and summarized.3 | RESULTSThe initial search strategy resulted in 739 articles. Eighty-six articles were identified as appropriate for full-text review after title and abstract screening (see modified PRISMA diagram, Figure 1).TABLES AND FIGUREStable/figure thumbnailFigure 1.

Summary of articles included in systematic review (N = 38)View larger image > in this page > in new window> Download slideTwenty-eight studies (74%) assessed providers' attitudes toward specific modes of TMH-V treatment, for which the patient population and the location of patients' care were identified; the remaining ten studies (26%) were surveys of providers' attitudes toward TMH-V more generally. Seventeen studies exclusively sampled providers with TMH-V experience (45%), 19 studies included providers both with and without experience (50%), and two studies exclusively sampled providers with no experience (5%). TMH-V was described as having various uses, including providing psychotherapy (22/38, 58%), short-term consultation and assessment (17/38, 45%), and medication management (12/35, 34%). Twenty-eight studies specified the locations at which patients received TMH-V care, including hospitals and clinics (21/28, 75%), within their homes (5/28, 18%), or in other locations, including schools, youth centers, crisis homes, or community centers (4/28, 14%). Fifteen studies involved the treatment of child and adolescent patients (39%), ten included military personnel/veterans (26%), and three included indigenous populations (8%). Eighteen studies (47%) were conducted outside of the United States, including Canada (7/38, 18%), Australia (5/38, 13%), and the United Kingdom (3/38, 8%). One study was conducted in each of the following countries: China, Finland, Italy, and Norway.3.1 | Overall attitudes toward TMH-V3.1.1 | Positive attitudesOverall attitudes toward TMH-V were largely positive (Adler, Pritchett, Kauth, & Nadorff, 2014; Baird, Whitney, & Caedo, 2018; Brooks, Manson, Bair, Dailey, & Shore, 2012; Cunningham, Connors, Lever, & Stephan, 2013; Levy & Strachan, 2013; Mitchell, MacLaren, Morton, & Carachi, 2009; Moreau et al., 2018; Whitten & Kuwahara, 2004; Wynn, Bergvik, Pettersen, & Fossum, 2012), such that providers were satisfied with TMH-V (Interian, King, St. Hill, Robinson, & Damschroder, 2017; Lindsay et al., 2017; Mayworm et al., 2019; Ruskin et al., 2004) and favorable toward its use (Cipolletta & Mocellin, 2018; Moreau et al., 2018), describing it as important (Glover, Williams, Hazlett, & Campbell, 2013; Volpe, Boydell, & Pignatiello, 2013) and an acceptable mode of treatment delivery (Elford et al., 2001, 2000; Thomas et al., 2017). These positive opinions were observed across types of services provided, location of TMH-V care, and patient populations.Providers' positive attitudes most frequently included reference to the UTAUT construct of performance expectancy, with multiple articles describing the innovation as being effective (Jameson, Farmer, Head, Fortney, & Teal, 2011; Perle, Burt, & Higgins, 2014; Starling & Foley, 2006) and useful (Gelber, 2001; Gibson, O'Donnell, Coulson, & Kakepetum-Scghultz, 2011; Glueckauf et al., 2018; Kopel, Nunn, & Dossetor, 2001; Simms, Gibson, & O'Donnell, 2011). One statistical analysis found that providers' perception of usefulness was the most important factor in determining intention to use TMH-V based on questionnaire data (Monthuy-Blanc, Bouchard, Maïano, & Seguin, 2013), consistent with UTAUT hypotheses (Venkatesh et al., 2003). Six subconstructs of performance expectancy were identified (Table 2).TABLES AND FIGUREStable/figure thumbnailTable 2. Positive aspects of TMH-V generated by providersView larger image > in this page > in new window> Download slideThe most commonly endorsed subconstruct was increasing access to care, such as for patients in remote locations, with disabilities or illnesses that made travel difficult, or with child or elder care responsibilities, as well as allowing for care during inclement weather (16/38, 42%; see Table 2 for included studies). The second most frequently endorsed benefit was saving time and money and increasing efficiency of services (12/38, 32%). Multiple articles also shared provider sentiments that TMH-V could have advantages over in-person care in some circumstances, such as by increasing patient comfort and decreasing inhibition when discussing sensitive subjects including trauma (8/38, 21%). Several of these advantages over in-person care were specific to providing TMH-V directly to patients' homes versus to another clinic (Gordon, Wang, & Tune, 2015; Lindsay et al., 2017). These included allowing care to be received discreetly and privately at home, offering a window into a patient's living environment, and serving as a stepping stone into care for avoidant patients. Receiving feedback that patients liked TMH-V was also noted as a positive aspect (6/38, 16%). TMH-V was described as providing increased flexibility, such as by allowing providers to work from different locations or check in more easily with high-risk patients (4/38, 11%). TMH-V was also mentioned as providing new job opportunities for providers, expanding the reach of their work, and facilitating increased collaboration with other clinicians (3/38, 8%).Regarding effort expectancy, multiple articles reported that providers found TMH-V to be easy to use (7/38, 18%). The remaining two constructs were discussed less frequently. In terms of social influence, several articles described the positive impact of supportive leadership on providers' attitudes toward TMH-V (3/38, 8%). Facilitating conditions, such as having strong technical support services, were also mentioned in several articles (4/38, 11%).3.1.2 | Negative attitudesAlthough overall attitudes toward TMH-V were largely positive, there were several exceptions. A minority of psychiatrists (4 of 11) reported being satisfied providing medication management through TMH-V in one study (Wagnild, Leenknecht, & Zauher, 2006). They described technological and scheduling barriers, perceptions of TMH-V as impersonal, and reinforcement of patients' social isolation as drawbacks. Two studies reported difficulty recruiting clinicians to provide TMH-V care (Adler et al., 2014; Shulman, John, & Kane, 2017). Reasons for providers opting to not participate included lack of interest (Adler et al., 2014) and concerns about technological issues (Shulman et al., 2017); both studies noted that perceptions of extra effort and hassle associated with TMH-V were deterrents.Multiple drawbacks to TMH-V use were noted regarding performance expectancy, including articles that reported positive attitudes toward TMH-V overall. Six subconstructs were identified, and the frequency with which they were endorsed is reported in Table 3.TABLES AND FIGUREStable/figure thumbnailTable 3. Negative aspects of TMH-V generated by providersView larger image > in this page > in new window> Download slideConcerns were often raised regarding TMH-V being impersonal or interfering with the therapeutic relationship. Difficulties detecting nonverbal cues such as fidgeting or crying, poor hygiene, or signs of intoxication were noted, along with trouble maintaining eye contact and disruptions to conversation flow (19/38, 50%; see Table 3 for included studies). Safety and legal concerns were common, including the inability to be physically present to assess for risk and coordinate patient transfer to a hospital; some providers questioned their liability in the case of a crisis and the limitations of their licenses, such as whether they could legally see a patient via TMH-V across state lines (13/38, 34%). Some providers felt that patients would not like using the TMH-V modality as compared to in-person visits (8/38, 21%). A lack of provider knowledge regarding TMH-V security and confidentiality was noted in several articles (7/38, 18%). Providers also raised the possibility that certain patients, such as those with hearing or visual impairments, or those who are socially isolated or high risk, would not be appropriate for TMH-V care (5/38, 13%). Finally, some noted an inability to conduct a thorough assessment, including a physical examination, using TMH-V (6/38, 16%).The most frequently endorsed concern fell within the construct of effort expectancy and involved technological problems, including suboptimal audio and video quality, insufficient bandwidth to support videoconferencing, and malfunctions during treatment sessions (23/38, 61%). TMH-V was also often associated with increased workload and hassle due to factors such as equipment setup and additional scheduling processes (16/38, 42%). With respect to social influence, two studies (5%) mentioned the negative impact of having poor communication or support from leadership regarding TMH-V. In terms of facilitating conditions, several articles described a need for technical support and training (9/38, 24%), as well as having limited access to TMH-V equipment, clinic space, and funding (6/38, 16%).3.2 | Attitude variability related to extent of TMH-V experience3.2.1 | Users versus nonusersSeveral studies drew comparisons between users and nonusers of TMH-V within their samples. Compared to those with no experience, users had more positive attitudes toward TMH-V (Adler et al., 2014; Gilmore & Ward-Ciesielski, 2019) and expressed more confidence regarding their ability to provide care through TMH-V (Adler et al., 2014; Austen & McGrath, 2006). Providers with TMH-V experience were less likely to cite drawbacks to use such as staffing and credentialing concerns (Adler et al., 2014) or difficulties operating the technology, managing high-risk patients, or developing a therapeutic alliance (Interian et al., 2017). Predictors of increased use of TMH-V included finding the technology easy to use and having a history of training (Gibson et al., 2011; Glover et al., 2013; Simms et al., 2011) as well as having more years in practice (Gilmore & Ward-Ciesielski, 2019; Simms et al., 2011). A study of psychiatry residents found that those in rural as opposed to urban settings were more likely to plan on using TMH-V after residency (Glover et al., 2013). One study noted that younger age was related to TMH-V use (Gilmore & Ward-Ciesielski, 2019); however, more years in practice was also reported as predictive of TMH-V use, making this finding difficult to interpret given that these variables would likely be negatively correlated.3.2.2 | Preuse versus postuseAlthough relatively few studies assessed providers' attitudes before and after TMH-V use, the majority revealed an increase in positive sentiments with experience. Studies reported increases in positive opinions (Brooks et al., 2012; Whitten & Kuwahara, 2004), interest (Glover et al., 2013), comfort level (Gelber, 2001), and ease of use of the technology (Gibson et al., 2011), as well as decreases in providers' skepticism (Elford et al., 2000) and apprehension (Brooks et al., 2012) following use. Several studies reported that providers were pleasantly surprised after trying TMH-V, noting that it was “much better than I thought it would be” (Elford et al., 2000), and caused less disruption to clinical care (Adler et al., 2014) and rapport development (Lindsay et al., 2017) than anticipated. Multiple studies noted that providers were surprised by their patients' generally positive attitudes toward TMH-V (Adler et al., 2014; Brooks et al., 2012; Kopel et al., 2001; Newman, Bidargaddi, & Schrader, 2016), their willingness to participate, and the speed at which they adapted to this new mode of treatment delivery (Whitten & Kuwahara, 2004). In contrast, one qualitative study noted that two providers characterized TMH-V consultations as “twice as hard” to conduct as in-person sessions because of poor audio and video quality; they described being unable to detect nonverbal cues and needing to use shorter sentences and exaggerated gestures (Starling & Foley, 2006). However, it is worth noting that this study was published in 2006 and that the technology being evaluated is likely not representative of the current quality of TMH-V platforms.Some providers with TMH-V experience noted that the benefits of TMH-V outweighed its various drawbacks and described the development of strategies and workarounds to address barriers encountered during use (Gibson et al., 2011; Lindsay et al., 2017; Simms et al., 2011). These included developing relationships with local law enforcement and hospitals to implement safety protocols in the case of a patient emergency, panning the camera around the provider's treatment room to reassure wary patients that no one else was overhearing their confidential session, or completing the remainder of a session by phone if the video connection unexpectedly failed.3.3 | Additional distinctions in providers' attitudes3.3.1 | Provider satisfaction with TMH-V versus in-person careMost studies comparing providers' opinions toward TMH-V and in-person care found the latter to be more desirable. Providers reported preferring in-person care when completing child assessments and interventions (Elford et al., 2000; Levy & Strachan, 2013), and psychodynamic therapists described TMH-V as being slightly less effective than in-person sessions (Gordon et al., 2015). A minority of psychiatry residents with TMH-V experience felt that TMH-V was equal to face-to-face encounters (34%; 40% noted that it was not equal, and 26% were neutral; Glover et al., 2013). Providers conducted both TMH-V and in-person sessions in four intervention studies included in this review: a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of psychologists completing a cognitive behavioral therapy protocol for bulimia (Ertelt et al., 2011), an RCT of psychiatrists providing medication management and supportive counseling (Ruskin et al., 2004), a non-RCT in which psychologists conducted clinical intake interviews (Schopp, Johnstone, & Merrell, 2000), and a non-RCT in which psychiatrists provided school-based medication management and assessment to children (Mayworm et al., 2019). In-person sessions were rated significantly higher in terms of provider satisfaction (Mayworm et al., 2019; Ruskin et al., 2004; Schopp et al., 2000), as well as providers' perception of goal formation, task completion, and development of a therapeutic bond (Ertelt et al., 2011). Three of these four studies shared that, despite being significantly lower than in-person scores, TMH-V ratings remained high (Ertelt et al., 2011; Mayworm et al., 2019; Ruskin et al., 2004). Several studies reported that providers found TMH-V to be adequate (Kopel et al., 2001), equivalent (Elford et al., 2001), or an acceptable alternative (Elford et al., 2000; Thomas et al., 2017) to in-person sessions, noting that there was “little to no difference” in care (Volpe et al., 2013). It is notable that these studies examined short-term consultation or assessment services delivered via TMH-V versus longer term psychotherapy or medication management.3.3.2 | TMH-V provider satisfaction as compared to patients and referring providersStudies that compared provider and patient attitudes toward TMH-V found patients to be more satisfied than providers on average (Cruz, Krupinski, Lopez, & Weinstein, 2005; Shulman et al., 2017; Thomas et al., 2017). Providers rated working alliance measures as lower for TMH-V versus in-person sessions of a cognitive behavioral therapy protocol, while there were no significant differences in patient-rated scores between modalities (Ertelt et al., 2011). Another study reported that providers found technical difficulties to be more problematic and burdensome than patients; the authors posited that patients were more accustomed to experiencing delays when receiving health care as compared to providers (Schopp et al., 2000). In a study of emergency room providers who requested TMH-V consultation from a psychiatrist or social worker at a remote hospital, the providers requesting the patient consultation were more satisfied with the service than the providers conducting the TMH-V session (Thomas et al., 2017). It was hypothesized that the workflow of those providing TMH-V consultation was impacted more than the workflow of the requesting providers.3.4 | Risk of biasThere is the risk of publication bias within the current review, such that negative or contradictory findings regarding providers' attitudes toward TMH-V may have been omitted from results sections or may have precluded publication of completed research altogether. A risk of selection bias was identified within all included studies. Specifically, it is possible that the providers who opted to complete TMH-V surveys or participate in TMH-V intervention protocols may be categorically different from providers who opted out. Only one study (Shulman et al., 2017) reported the number of providers who elected to participate relative to the total number approached. Performance bias can occur within unblinded studies and refers to the provision of increased attention to the experimental group (i.e., those receiving TMH-V) as compared to the control group, beyond the scope of the actual intervention. Four studies assigned patients to TMH-V or in-person care (Ertelt et al., 2011; Mayworm et al., 2019; Ruskin et al., 2004; Schopp et al., 2000); providers in these studies may have given additional attention to patients in the TMH-V condition given the novelty of this modality, which could have impacted their subsequent perceptions of TMH-V effectiveness. Performance bias was also possible in the multiple other intervention studies without an in-person control condition, as providers may have put more effort into TMH-V sessions conducted within the context of a research study. Detection bias is also inevitable in this context, given that the main outcomes of this review are providers' attitudes toward using TMH-V, preventing any sort of blinding regarding treatment condition when considering outcomes. Attrition bias is a significant concern among the included intervention studies. Only one study (Adler et al., 2014) reported on the observed attrition rate of therapists, with attrition here referring to inability to ultimately provide TMH-V care due to clinic and organization-level barriers. The remaining studies only included providers who participated in the full intervention within their samples, inviting the possibility that providers who ultimately dropped out of the intervention or were unable to provide TMH-V were not accounted for in analyses. Selective reporting bias is also likely given that many included studies did not clearly specify outcomes of interest within their analytic plans.4 | DISCUSSIONThe current systematic review revealed a diverse and growing literature examining providers' attitudes toward TMH-V, and findings were positive overall. TMH-V was described as improving access to care for patients, increasing efficiency of services, saving time and money, and being more effective than in-person care in some circumstances. Additional benefits included TMH-V being easy to use, well-received by patients, supported by organizational leadership, and facilitated by strong training and technical support systems. While few articles reported negative overall attitudes toward TMH-V, many drawbacks to use were mentioned across studies. Technological difficulties were the most common concern and were reported in the majority of articles. Increased hassle and workload were also frequently mentioned. Most studies noted that TMH-V could feel impersonal, interfere with the therapeutic relationship, or impede the detection of nonverbal cues. Some providers reported beliefs that patients would not like TMH-V or that certain patients would not be appropriate to receive care remotely. Safety, security, liability, and confidentiality concerns were noted, as was the difficulty of conducting a thorough assessment via TMH-V. Lack of facilitating conditions, including training and technical support, was also endorsed. Poor support from leadership was a less frequently mentioned contributor to negative attitudes.This finding that overall attitudes toward TMH-V were positive despite the presence of many drawbacks suggests that the relative weights of its benefits and disadvantages are not equal. Specifically, the perceived benefits of increasing efficiency, flexibility, and access to care for patients may offset the relative impersonality of TMH-V as well as its technological difficulties and increased provider burden. This finding aligns with the UTAUT, which posits that the performance expectancy of an innovation is the most significant predictor of its acceptance (Venkatesh et al., 2003).Current findings also suggest a relationship between experience using TMH-V and providers' attitudes. Specifically, providers with experience using TMH-V reported more acceptance of the modality than nonusers. A trend emerged in which providers experienced increases in positive sentiments upon using TMH-V, including being, “pleasantly surprised” by its functionality and ease of use (Adler et al., 2014; Elford et al., 2000; Lindsay et al., 2017). These findings, while tentative, align with UTAUT predictions, such that the perceived effort required to use an innovation declines following experience interacting with and adjusting to the technology (Venkatesh et al., 2003). In keeping with this theory, workflow modifications would become practiced over time and require less hassle on the part of the provider. Furthermore, experienced providers described developing strategies and workarounds to address barriers to use. This suggests that with experience, providers can mitigate some of the negative aspects of TMH-V, contributing to more positive overall attitudes toward the innovation.However, while providers' attitudes toward TMH-V tended to improve with experience, they still generally displayed a preference for conducting appointments in person versus via TMH-V. The exception to this finding involved short-term consultation and assessment procedures, in which TMH-V was deemed largely equivalent to in-person sessions. Therefore, TMH-V satisfaction may vary based on the nature of services being provided. For example, difficulties establishing a therapeutic alliance from behind a screen may have a larger impact within longer term care, in which the alliance develops over time and is an important predictor of therapy success (Martin, Garske, & Davis, 2000), as compared to brief patient interactions that do not involve follow-up. These difficulties may particularly impact psychologists, who may be more likely to have frequent and longer sessions with patients (e.g., weekly evidence-based treatment protocols) as opposed to providers primarily offering brief consultations or periodic medication management appointments. Findings emphasize the importance of optimizing audio and video quality to improve the ability to connect with patients via TMH-V, by increasing detection of subtle nonverbal cues and minimizing audio and video lags that can disrupt conversation flow. Through training, providers can also be made aware of these drawbacks and develop new strategies, for instance adjusting camera placement to ensure proper angles and lighting to best see and be seen by the patient, or maintaining a low threshold to inquire about recent substance use, given the greater difficulty of detecting intoxication remotely (Shore, 2013). That being said, there may be instances in which an in-person appointment is deemed necessary to conduct a thorough assessment (e.g., to measure vital signs if the patient does not have a home monitoring device such as a personal blood pressure cuff). This will likely be a greater barrier to prescribing clinicians or behavioral medicine specialists as opposed to those who do not conduct physical examinations as part of their treatment protocols.Although TMH-V satisfaction levels were high overall, providers reported lower satisfaction than their patients. It is possible that the perceived drawbacks of establishing a therapeutic relationship via TMH-V may be more salient to providers than to patients, as noted in one study in which providers reported lower working alliance scores for TMH-V versus in-person sessions, while patient scores did not differ across modalities (Ertelt et al., 2011). The degree of effort required to use TMH-V also likely contributes to observed discrepancies in satisfaction. TMH-V represents a shift in the care model, such that providers are expected to reach out to their patients, versus their patients being expected to come to their office, a dynamic that redistributes effort expenditures and may in turn affect satisfaction. Indeed, TMH-V is more likely to impose burdens on providers—in terms of undergoing training and integrating new technologies and processes into their preexisting workflows—as compared to patients, for whom TMH-V is intended to decrease the more burdensome aspects of care. Furthermore, patients may be more accustomed to encountering delays and adapting to unfamiliar systems when receiving care as compared to their providers (Schopp et al., 2000).Several aspects of the UTAUT were notably underrepresented within the reviewed articles. Although many articles discussed the moderating role of experience, there was little to no information shared regarding the role of gender, age, and voluntariness of use on providers' acceptance of TMH-V. Future research should aim to examine these factors as they may influence attitudes toward TMH-V adoption. Indeed, findings of demographic differences within the broader mental health technology literature are complex and not consistent across studies (Glueckauf et al., 2018; McMinn, Bearse, Heyne, Smithberger, & Erb, 2011). There was also relatively little information provided regarding social influence from leadership or contextual factors. The role of organizational support can significantly influence providers' attitudes, as discussed within established implementation frameworks (e.g., CFIR; Damschroder et al., 2009). Indeed, one study in the current review emphasized the importance of developing an organization-level “telehealth culture” involving information sharing across providers, policy development, training, and system-wide changes in administrative systems and staffing to ensure successful and sustained uptake of TMH-V (Newman et al., 2016).Developing a TMH-V implementation plan, including formalized education, training, and supervision, as well as the involvement of experienced facilitators, can help to increase provider buy-in, enthusiasm, and confidence navigating this new technology (Fletcher et al., 2018). These strategies will be especially important to consider when moving beyond small-scale trials and toward the widespread integration of TMH-V into general practice. Ideally, successive generations of providers will receive TMH-V education and training as part of their graduate programs, which will increase the ubiquity of these services. However, postgraduate training is necessary to ensure that current providers gain comfort and experience navigating this technology and that these skills are maintained over time as technologies continue to evolve. It is notable that few of the reviewed studies described the nature and extent of TMH-V education and training received by providers. Future studies should prioritize examination of these factors and their influence on providers' attitudes toward TMH-V.Limitations to the current conclusions must be noted, particularly regarding the observed relationship between attitudes toward TMH-V and experience. Importantly, there is no way to determine the causality of provider sentiments; for instance, providers with more positive a priori opinions toward TMH-V or who experienced fewer barriers to use may have been more likely to ultimately use TMH-V. Alternatively, use of TMH-V may have subsequently increased providers' positive opinions. Similarly, selection bias may exist in study designs; for instance, providers with more positive attitudes toward TMH-V may have been more likely to participate in the included studies, while providers who were unable to integrate TMH-V into their practice, who discontinued TMH-V use, or who had negative attitudes overall may not be adequately represented. In addition, many articles did not distinguish between providers with or without TMH-V experience when describing attitudes toward use. This represents a significant limitation as the potential moderating role of experience could not be examined, such as whether there was variation in the number or type of drawbacks endorsed by these groups. Furthermore, measures of providers' attitudes and satisfaction with TMH-V were highly variable across studies as there is no “gold standard” measurement of these constructs, which prevents direct comparison of findings and limits overall interpretations. Additional limitations include the omission of non-English-language publications and the small sample sizes of some of the included studies. Indeed, the experience of implementing and using TMH-V within a small trial may be very different from attempts to integrate TMH-V into larger and more complex settings. Although a consensus approach was used to determine article inclusion, the systematic review analyses were conducted by the first author and did not involve additional formal consensus procedures, which could be considered a limitation. However, all co-authors provided critical feedback regarding the analytic plan and presentation of current findings. Finally, 12 of the included studies were published over 10 years ago, and given the time taken to conduct and publish research, many of the more recent studies are likely also referring to technologies that are now somewhat outdated. Given the fast-moving pace of innovation, it is possible that some of the drawbacks discussed in this review may be specific to older TMH-V equipment and processes that have since been refined. This in turn limits the potential generalizability of these findings to current conditions and emphasizes the need for ongoing review of the literature as TMH-V technology continues to evolve and improve.Although the current review focused on TMH-V, it is important to note that additional technologies may fall within the domain of telemental health, including e-mail, smartphone apps, message boards, or web-based therapy protocols. Two of the studies included in the current review surveyed providers' attitudes toward telemental health technologies more broadly, with only TMH-V results reported here (Cipolletta & Mocellin, 2018; Glueckauf et al., 2018). Future work should aim to synthesize findings from papers that evaluate multiple forms of telemental health concurrently, in order to examine variation in provider attitudes based on mental health technology type. Future studies should also examine whether there may be discipline-level variability in providers' attitudes toward TMH-V that may relate to differences in typical encounter characteristics; for instance, whether prescribing clinicians with less frequent and shorter appointments with their patients may have more positive views toward TMH-V than psychologists with longer and more frequent sessions.The finding that providers' positivity toward TMH-V may have outweighed various barriers to use could have important implications when attempting to implement this technology in practice. If providers believe that using TMH-V will improve overall access to care and ultimately increase efficiency and flexibility, they may be more willing to accept initial increases in hassle and disruptions in workflow, as well as an altered quality of connection with patients. This distinction is important to consider when introducing TMH-V to providers, specifically preparing providers for the inevitable growing pains of adopting this new technology, but emphasizing the net benefits that TMH-V may provide to their patients and themselves with sustained use.The balance between perceived benefits and drawbacks of TMH-V among providers is also likely to continually shift in response to rapid advances occurring in the field. Improvements in the quality of communication via TMH-V, due to strengthened broadband connectivity and increasingly sophisticated video and audio technologies, may help to lessen the relative disadvantages of connecting with a patient from behind a screen (Brooks et al., 2013). With continued use and troubleshooting, TMH-V will ideally become more seamlessly integrated into electronic health record, scheduling, and billing platforms, which would relieve a substantial amount of staff burden. In addition, the introduction of legislation allowing for the wider provision of telehealth, such as a recently enacted bill allowing TMH-V to occur across state lines within the Veterans Health Administration, as well as similar legislation within the Department of Defense, will decrease logistical barriers to care (Brooks et al., 2013; U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, 2018; Zur, 2019). State laws requiring insurers to reimburse TMH-V appointments to the same extent as in-person care (i.e., parity laws) will also be critical in increasing uptake, as will the relaxation of mandates in some states requiring out-of-state providers to obtain special licenses to provide telehealth services (Adler-Milstein, Kvedar, & Bates, 2014). In fact, a Psychology Interjurisdictional Compact (PSYPACT), which would provide a streamlined certification process for psychologists to conduct TMH-V across state lines, is currently in development (Wicklund, 2019b); similar compacts have already taken effect for physicians and nurses across multiple states (Wicklund, 2019a). The development and dissemination of established clinical competencies and guidelines for care will also likely help to standardize TMH-V practices and increase provider confidence (Hilty, Maheu, Drude, & Hertlein, 2018; Shore et al., 2018). Furthermore, providers' comfort interacting with patients via TMH-V may continue to increase as videoconferencing becomes ubiquitous across multiple domains, from coordinating remote work meetings to connecting with family members using smartphone video chat features.It is also worth noting that many of the most unique strengths of TMH-V involve providing services directly to patients' homes versus to remote clinics—for instance allowing immobile and severely ill patients to receive care, providing a window into a patients' living environment, and serving as a stepping stone into services for avoidant or highly anxious patients (Fletcher et al., 2018; Gordon et al., 2015; Lindsay et al., 2017). Advancements in technology, including improved wireless connectivity and facilitated access to smartphones and tablets, will allow more TMH-V to take place within patients' homes, which may further increase the relative advantages of this modality. Only five of the included studies in this review delivered TMH-V to patients' homes, and four of those studies were published in the past three years, highlighting the relative novelty of this modality and the need for additional research to understand possible effects of TMH-V delivery location (e.g., clinic or home) on provider and patient perceptions as well as clinical outcomes.Yet importantly, current findings reveal that providers prefer in-person contact when given the choice. It therefore remains likely that regardless of future advancements in technology, in-person contact will continue to be preferred by many providers and patients when it is easily accessible. As such, TMH-V can be viewed as one of many effective treatment modalities whose relative advantage will vary depending on the unique circumstances of each clinical contact. For some patients with significant barriers to receiving in-person care, TMH-V technology may represent the first and only way in which they are able to undergo therapy. Even if a provider may generally prefer in-person appointments when given the choice, the benefit of providing therapy via TMH-V to a patient who otherwise would receive none is clear. A hybrid model of care may be ideal in other cases, such that patients receive a combination of in-person and TMH-V sessions based on changing needs over the course of therapy (Yellowlees & Nafiz, 2010). These hybrid care structures will likely become more common as TMH-V uptake increases, and their use and effectiveness should be studied.In sum, the current review revealed that providers' attitudes toward TMH-V are positive overall, despite the acknowledgment of multiple drawbacks to its use. This finding suggests that the relative advantages of TMH-V in certain circumstances, such as increasing access to care where services are limited, may outweigh its various disadvantages from the provider perspective. Gaining experience conducting TMH-V sessions with patients may lessen perceived drawbacks of use and foster the development of strategies and workarounds to improve care delivery. As health-care systems increasingly prioritize TMH-V, it will be crucial to consider providers' attitudes and perspectives when working to facilitate uptake, as they will play a key role in the successful implementation of this innovation. Exposure to potentially traumatic events (e.g., physical abuse, sexual abuse, witnessing domestic or community violence, violent or unexpected death of a loved one) is a significant public health concern with approximately half of all youth reporting experiencing at least one type of potentially traumatic event before the age of 18 (Finkelhor, Turner, Shattuck, & Hamby, 2013; Kilpatrick et al., 2003). Trauma exposure increases the risk of a number of mental health problems and disorders including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, anxiety disorders, externalizing problems, and substance use disorders (Kessler, 2000). Despite high rates of trauma exposure and subsequent mental health outcomes, many children in need of mental health care still do not receive it, receive an inadequate “dose” of sessions, or do not receive evidence-based care (Alegría, Vallas, & Pumariega, 2010; Comer & Barlow, 2014). Even greater health disparities are seen across geographies (e.g., rural locations) and among racial and ethnic minority youth (Merikangas et al., 2011; “New Freedom Commission,” 2007).Telepsychotherapy Can Extend the Reach of Evidence-Based TreatmentTelepsychotherapy (also referred to as telemental health or telehealth), offers an innovative way to address significant gaps in access to care. Telepsychotherapy refers to the use of interactive, real-time (synchronous) technologies, such as videoconferencing, to deliver psychotherapy to patients (Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, 2019). Secure videoconferencing technology allows providers and youth/families at different locations to interact in real time. It is a relatively low-cost technology solution because mental health interventions largely rely on conversation rather than the need for the expensive peripheral devices (e.g., electronic otoscope or stethoscope) that are used in some telemedicine applications. Additionally, youth often have extensive exposure to and comfort with technology, including videoconference software, and thus, telepsychotherapy may be a particularly good fit for this age group (Nelson, Cain, & Sharp, 2017).Telepsychotherapy has the potential to address several barriers in the accessibility of evidence-based care. First, telepsychotherapy can overcome distance and time barriers to treatment and minimize conflicts with job and child care responsibilities (Comer, Elkins, Chan, & Jones, 2014). For example, telepsychotherapy reduces travel time and thus can decrease interference with caregiver work schedules and missed school time for patients. In addition to the distance and time barriers, patients and families also report that they utilize telepsychotherapy to decrease costs associated with traveling long distances for care and to decrease stigma by connecting to child friendly locations such as schools (Gloff, LeNoue, Novins, & Myers, 2015).Current evidence provides some support that services delivered via telehealth are efficacious in addressing a number of disorders in youth such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (Myers, Vander Stoep, Zhou, McCarty, & Katon, 2015), obsessive–compulsive disorder (Comer, Furr, Kerns, et al., 2017), disruptive and oppositional behavior (Comer et al., 2015), depression (Nelson, Barnard, & Cain, 2003), PTSD (Stewart, Orengo-Aguayo, Cohen, Mannarino, & de Arellano, 2017), and other mental health problems (see Gloff et al., 2015, for a review). Comprehensive reviews of child telehealth have found good clinical outcomes in both rural and urban settings (e.g., Cain, Nelson, & Myers, 2015; Gloff et al., 2015; Nelson & Sharp, 2016), with high rates of diagnostic accuracy, practical feasibility of methods employed, and satisfaction across patients and caregivers (Hilty et al., 2016; Myers, Palmer, & Geyer, 2011).Delivery of Trauma-Focused Treatment for Children and Adolescents via TelepsychotherapyAlthough the published literature supporting telepsychotherapy delivery of evidence-based treatments for children is expanding, there is still a dearth of literature evaluating trauma-focused treatment for children delivered via telepsychotherapy. To our knowledge, there is only one small proof of concept feasibility study (Stewart, Orengo-Aguayo, Cohen, et al., 2017) and several case studies demonstrating feasibility and preliminary evidence of symptom reduction (Jones et al., 2014; Stewart, Orengo-Aguayo, Wallace, Metzger, & Rheingold, 2019; Stewart, Orengo-Aguayo, Gilmore, & de Arellano, 2017). Additional community-based studies are needed to establish feasibility and effectiveness of a telepsychotherapy service delivery model for childhood posttraumatic stress treatment in real world environments. This has become even more salient in the midst of the COVID-19 global pandemic of 2020, which has forced mental health providers (and many other health care professions) to transition to a telehealth service delivery modality in the interest of public safety.Trauma-focused cognitive–behavioral therapy (TF-CBT; Cohen, Mannarino, & Deblinger, 2017) is an evidence-based treatment for trauma-exposed youth that has garnered robust empirical support. Over 21 randomized trials have demonstrated support for its efficacy in improving PTSD symptoms across a variety of service settings in both the United States and globally (Cohen et al., 2017, pp. 74–80; de Arellano et al., 2014). TF-CBT is ideal for disseminating and testing via a telehealth model of delivery as a means to reduce barriers in access to evidence-based, trauma-focused treatment.Present StudyIn 2015, our team developed the Telehealth Outreach Program (TOP) to deliver evidence-based, trauma-focused care to children and adolescents living in seven diverse communities across South Carolina. This effort involved ongoing program evaluation data regarding TF-CBT delivered to children via telepsychotherapy sessions conducted at either their schools or homes. This included measurement of practical feasibility variables (reflected in the number of sessions attended and rates of treatment completion), as well as pre–post comparison of clinically relevant treatment outcome variables (captured via standardized, psychometrically sound self-reports and structured clinical interviews). The methods for data extraction and aggregation entailed closed chart review of patients who received services through the TOP clinic (which received institutional review board approval).

The sample had a mean age of 12.73 years (SD = 3.34) with the following demographic distribution: 81.4% female, 58.6% Hispanic, 30.0% African American, and 11.4% Caucasian. A total of 42.9% of youth had an index trauma of either sexual (n = 24) or physical (n = 6) abuse; 21.4% (n = 15) experienced the traumatic loss of a loved one; 18.6% (n = 13) witnessed domestic or community violence; 8.6% (n = 6) experienced or witnessed armed robbery; and 8.6% (n = 6) had other index traumas such as traumatic medical procedures, car accidents, and so forth. Fifty-six percent of youth also endorsed experiencing additional secondary traumas. All children met criteria for PTSD (n = 60), adjustment disorder (n = 9), or other specified trauma and stressor related disorder (n = 1) according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (5th ed; DSM–5; American Psychiatric Association, 2013) at the time of treatment initiation, assessed via a structured clinical interview and self-report assessments at intake. Patient barriers to traditional treatment access included lack of transportation, child caregiver work schedule, lack of childcare, residence in a rural area with limited access to treatment providers, and/or need for services to be conducted in Spanish. With regard to the latter, 34.3% of children (n = 24) and 57.1% of parents (n = 40) requested Spanish-language materials and services.To overcome these barriers, patients received remote services either at school or home, in Spanish or English, as part of an ongoing telehealth program development project. TOP was initially funded as a pilot project in 2015 through a Duke Endowment Grant and subsequently funded through the South Carolina Telehealth Alliance and a Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration National Child Traumatic Stress Network grant. The program currently provides trauma-focused treatment for youth in seven underserved communities across South Carolina. The program receives referrals from schools, child advocacy centers, law enforcement agencies, mental health clinics, and other community agencies and provides assessment, TF-CBT treatment, and psychiatric medication management services as needed.Broader inclusionary criteria for the current study were as follows: (a) patient age between 7 and 18 years; (b) at least one remembered/reported trauma on the University of California at Los Angeles PTSD Reaction Index (UCLA-PTSD-RI; Kaplow et al., 2020; Steinberg, Brymer, Decker, & Pynoos, 2004); (c) significant experience of posttraumatic stress, defined by self-report of at least three current symptoms of PTSD according to DSM–5 criteria; (d) presence of a caregiver who could participate in treatment as needed; (e) experience of at least one barrier to accessing traditional office-based treatment (e.g., rural location, caregiver work schedule, limited English proficiency); and (f) caregiver consent and child assent. Exclusionary criteria were (a) current significant suicidal ideation, (b) serious child externalizing behaviors that would endanger themselves or the telehealth equipment, or (c) under the age of 7. To expand on the latter, the therapist needed be able to view the child at all times via the web camera for safety reasons and children had to have attentional capacity sufficient to engage in a continuous 60 min of web-based interaction within this constraint. The research team colloquially found both of these criteria to be difficult with children younger than 7 (thus the rationale for a minimum age that was somewhat older than previous randomized TF-CBT trials that included much younger children).MeasuresUCLA-PTSD-RI (Kaplow et al., 2020; Steinberg et al., 2004)The UCLA-PTSD-RI assesses trauma exposure and posttraumatic stress symptoms corresponding to DSM criteria in youth between the ages of 7 and 18. Parent-, child-, and adolescent-report versions of the instrument are available, all of which comprise 17 items capturing respondent experience of PTSD symptoms. The instrument yields a total scale score, as well as subscale scores for reexperiencing, avoidance, and hyperarousal. Total scores range from 0 to 68, with higher scores representing more severe posttraumatic symptoms. The instrument has demonstrated good internal reliability in multiple studies, with Cronbach’s alphas between 0.90 and 0.96 (Kaplow et al., 2020; Roussos et al., 2005; Steinberg et al., 2013). Cutoff scores of 38 (DSM–IV version; Steinberg et al., 2004) and 35 (DSM–5; Kaplow et al., 2020) have been previously established as reflective of a likely diagnosis of PTSD. The instrument can be administered as either a self-report or clinician interview, the latter of which was the format used with youth and caregivers in the current study.Two additional notes about the use of the instrument in the current study are warranted. First, it was administered in Spanish to anyone (children or caregivers) whose stated preference was to communicate in that language. This translated version of the instrument is as yet unpublished but was obtained from the original author through a personal communication (Steinberg, May 9, 2017). As outlined in this communication, an extensive translation process was conducted that included forward translation from English to Spanish followed by back-translation and item-level refinement of any notable discrepancies. Second, two versions of the instrument were used, which corresponded to DSM–IV criteria for the first 50 patients and DSM–5 criteria for the last 20. Although the content changes between versions were minimal, scores on different versions of the measure were not directly comparable and adjustments to data analysis and presentation had to be made (see below).Short Mood Feeling Questionnaire (SMFQ; Angold et al., 1995)The SMFQ is a 13-item instrument to measure child and adolescent depression, comprising the 13 highest-loading items from the Mood Feeling Questionnaire–Long Form (Angold et al., 1995; Costello & Angold, 1988). Previous psychometric studies have exhibited good internal consistency of the measure (α = .85; Angold et al., 1995). Parent- and child-report versions of the instrument are available, and a score of 8 or higher on either form is indicative of likely depression. The original author was contacted to inquire about a Spanish translation of the instrument, which was reportedly developed across multiple organizations using a process very similar to that described above. As with the UCLA-PTSD-RI, the Spanish-language version of the instrument was administered to anyone with a stated preference for such (children or their parents).TreatmentTrauma-focused cognitive–behavioral therapyTF-CBT (Cohen et al., 2017) is an evidence-based, manualized treatment protocol used to treat posttraumatic stress symptoms in children and adolescents ages 3–18. TF-CBT is usually delivered in 12–24 weekly sessions and includes the following components: (a) psychoeducation, (b) parenting skills, (c) relaxation skills, (d) affective modulation skills, (e) cognitive processing skills, (f) trauma narration and processing, (g) in vivo mastery of trauma reminders, (h) conjoint child–parent sessions, and (i) enhancing safety or future development. Efficacy for TF-CBT has been established through numerous randomized controlled trials in a range of populations (Cohen et al., 2017).Treatment was provided by one of the following: (a) a licensed clinical psychologist (the first author), (b) a postdoctoral fellow with a doctoral degree in clinical psychology, (c) a clinical psychology intern with a master’s degree in clinical psychology, or (d) a licensed master’s-level social worker. Both doctoral-level therapists and three of six interns were bilingual in English and Spanish and capable of conducting services in either language. All study personnel received initial TF-CBT training from a licensed clinical psychologist who is a national trainer in TF-CBT, as well as weekly clinical supervision from a licensed clinical psychologist with expertise in TF-CBT.Telepsychotherapy connectionsThe clinical program examined was developed and refined according to the American Telemedicine Association’s and American Psychological Association’s current practice guidelines for telemental health, as well as published accounts of other technological, ethical, and administrative considerations (e.g., American Psychological Association, 2013; Myers et al., 2017; Shore et al., 2018). The hardware demands for rendering services were minimal, consisting on the therapist side of a desktop computer, web-camera, external speakers or a headset, and a microphone. For participants, hardware setups differed depending upon location, but requirements were similarly minimal. Participants receiving sessions at school connected using a laptop computer and headset device provided by the research team. Those receiving sessions at home had an array of connection options that depended upon their existing resources. When and where families had computers and access to sufficiently high-speed Internet, they could participate in home-based sessions using their own equipment. When families did not have access, however, the program provided them with an iPad (with the capability for cellular data transmission if needed), headset, and white noise machine for use to facilitate treatment. Software was selected to be similarly minimal in terms of learning demands and resources necessary to connect to treatment providers. Although many options for video communication are available, the current project entailed use of Vidyo (Vidyo Inc., 2010). Vidyo is videoconferencing software that conforms to Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act and Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health requirements and allows two-way, real-time communication in a low bandwidth environment. It also enables the capability for screen-sharing, which facilitates immediate display of handouts or other written materials with patients (Comer et al., 2014).ProcedureAssessmentParticipants referred for treatment initially engaged in a comprehensive clinical evaluation that included separate clinical interviews with child and caregiver(s), elicitation of trauma, medical, and psychiatric history, and completion of self-report instruments described above. These assessments were conducted either through telehealth or in-person meetings depending upon patient needs and logistical considerations for study-staff deployment. Preference for location of subsequent telepsychotherapy services was also discerned at this meeting, and eligible youths were scheduled to participate either at school or home. Self-report measures were repeated before beginning the trauma narration and processing component of treatment, which was an individually based and variably timed determination based on all available clinical data. The same clinical interview administered at baseline was repeated at the end of treatment, as were all self-reports. Participants did not receive compensation to complete assessments.TreatmentPrior to the first treatment session all participants (and their schools, when relevant) received assistance from staff in setting up the Vidyo software and testing their connections. This test entailed technical assessment of bandwidth and user interface viability as well as a tutorial from the study staff about Vidyo’s basic functions. Additionally, schools and/or families were given basic guidelines for the physical environment in which treatment should ideally occur, including selection of an isolated, quiet space that would ensure privacy, deactivation of cell phones or other alerts from electronic devices, and minimization of other distraction opportunities (e.g., other people; TV; using the computer/iPad for other purposes during sessions). Once treatment parameters were established, participants presented for approximately weekly telepsychotherapy TF-CBT sessions with academic medical center therapists (located between 30 and 150 miles away). Special considerations for the format of treatment included ensuring that all individuals present announced themselves, backup plans were made to conduct sessions by phone in the event of an Internet outage or technical malfunction, and specific procedures to handle potential safety issues remotely (adult present and available at all times in case of an emergency; 911 or police called if child was in imminent risk and could not be deescalated or kept safe).Patient and caregiver engagementCaregiver participation is an important component of TF-CBT, but also a simultaneously challenging issue in child mental health treatment in terms of effectively engaging caregivers, particularly in a school-based environment. (Gopalan et al., 2010). Our program utilized evidence-based strategies to enhance engagement through addressing logistical, perceptual, and cultural barriers to treatment engagement (Gopalan et al., 2010; McKay & Bannon, 2004). These strategies involved using reminder phone calls and text messages, directly addressing caregiver concerns and barriers at the time of the initial appointment and throughout treatment, and addressing beliefs and attitudes related to mental health treatment (particularly those likely to present barriers to receiving services).For the present study, 81% of youth (n = 57) had a caregiver who actively participated in treatment on a regular basis (i.e., attended treatment sessions weekly or biweekly). During each session, the therapist typically met individually with the child and then met conjointly with the child and caregiver or individually with child and caregiver at separate times for caregivers who were unable to attend sessions at their child’s school. For home-based telepsychotherapy cases (n = 24), the therapist was able to meet with the caregiver in the home via telehealth at the time of the session with the youth. For school-based telepsychotherapy cases (n = 46), caregivers could be scheduled to meet with the therapist at the school location. Alternatively, if the caregiver was unable to attend telepsychotherapy sessions at the child’s school, the child was seen at school via telepsychotherapy and the parent component was completed via computer or iPad at some other point (e.g., after the parent returned home from work or during the parent’s lunch break).Interactive electronic-format activities for delivering treatment content and promoting engagementTF-CBT is structured to make significant use of worksheets and visual aids to facilitate therapy being more interactive and engaging for children and adolescents. To implement these same strategies via telepsychotherapy a variety of techniques were implemented, including the development of electronic versions or treatment worksheets and handouts and the use of PowerPoint presentations and digital games. For example, worksheets and handouts designed for in-person therapeutic engagement were adapted to allow the therapist to use the “screen-share” function of the videoconferencing platform that allows real-time sharing of the therapist’s desktop view. We also created a series of interactive computer games that children play in session with their therapist to enhance the child’s understanding of treatment concepts. These programs allow both the therapist and patient to simultaneously see a working document in real-time during session; however, only the therapist was able to manipulate the documents and thus the child had to instruct the therapist which moves to make for him/her during the game. We used Microsoft PowerPoint, Word, and Excel and Adobe Acrobat to create our working documents and interactive games, thus making them portable and freely accessible to most environments (given the ubiquity of these software applications in professional settings).The majority of activities and games used in our telepsychotherapy program were adaptations of in-person clinic-based TF-CBT treatment activities, but others were new games created specifically for the purpose of telepsychotherapy sessions. One activity adapted from in-person TF-CBT treatment activities is the “How Do We Experience Feelings in Our Bodies?” activity (Hendricks, Cohen, Mannarino, & Deblinger, n.d.), which aims to help children review physiological responses to emotions. In clinic-based, in-person care, the therapist uses a worksheet that asks the child to indicate where in his or her body he or she feels specific emotions and then collaborates with the child to color in the worksheet. For the telepsychotherapy delivery format, we developed an interactive PDF document that provides children with an image of the worksheet, which they can color in with the assistance of the therapist by continually verbally communicating to direct the therapist as to where to color.An example of an interactive game we developed using PowerPoint (called “Feelings Memories”) reinforces emotion vocabulary in connection to real-life experiences. The child selects a tile numbered 1–12. Behind each numbered card are an emotion term and the instruction, “Tell me about a time when you felt (sad, mad, happy, scared, etc.).” The therapist and child take turns selecting a card and telling about a time when they felt the identified emotion. Other interactive games we developed are Jeopardy-style games presented via PowerPoint, which therapists use to review psychoeducation regarding sexual abuse, physical abuse, witnessing domestic violence, or traumatic grief, depending on the specific traumatic events each child had experienced.Other examples of telepsychotherapy-specific strategies include the use of interactive worksheets, PowerPoint presentations with content tailored to the child’s interests, video clips, and electronic versions of children’s books. For example, we utilized PowerPoint to create an animated activity for teaching about varying levels of emotions. This animation shows a thermometer with the temperature rising as emotions intensify. Additionally, we frequently used video clips. For example, when teaching about diaphragmatic breathing with a child who liked soccer, we used a video clip of a soccer player utilizing diaphragmatic breathing before a penalty kick. We also incorporated additional strategies while completing the trauma narrative. For example, a child dictated the trauma narrative while the clinician typed verbatim what the child says into a Word document. The therapist was able to “share” the therapist’s screen with the child so that he or she could see the words that the therapist was typing in real-time. Additionally, children colored pictures with crayons and paper to illustrate specific elements of the traumatic event, which could be displayed to the camera and captured by the clinician through a screenshot (and later used in the child’s trauma narrative, if applicable). Similarly, therapists could also work collaboratively with the child to create a PowerPoint version of the trauma narrative incorporating clipart or other picture-based methods of conveying their experiences.ResultsProcess Description and Qualitative Results: FeasibilityStrategies for providing TF-CBT via telepsychotherapyA primary concern in delivering TF-CBT via telepsychotherapy was patient safety. To address this concern, pretreatment site visits to schools were used to survey the physical premises and build relationships that would later serve to facilitate good communication between the treating clinicians and the school staff (e.g., guidance counselor). During each session of TF-CBT, clinicians had contact information readily available for school staff. All appointments took place during regular school hours of operations; accordingly, the school staff was available in case of emergencies. Notably, there were only two instances in which school staff needed to be contacted, and no instances in which local authorities needed to be contacted due to patient safety concerns. In both instances schools were contacted due to patient suicidal ideation. Additionally, in school-based sessions there was one instance in which a teenager inappropriately disengaged from the therapeutic communication (i.e., closed the laptop during the therapy session), which was quickly reconnected with a call to the identified school contact (guidance counselor). There was also one instance of a patient leaving her chair and crouching on the floor out of view of the camera, wherein the clinician successfully requested that the patient return to the chair.For home-based telepsychotherapy, a caregiver was always present in the home at the time of sessions. During each home-based session, clinicians had contact information available for the caregiver who was present in the home as well as additional emergency contacts for the child. Additionally, an emergency plan was discussed with each family that involved contacting local police or 911 if the clinician thought that the child or caregiver presented an imminent threat to themselves or others. No safety concerns arose during home-based TF-CBT telepsychotherapy sessions.Technical performance of the telepsychotherapy equipmentThere were few technical problems with the telepsychotherapy equipment. Occasionally, school sites and home-based patients experienced initial difficulty with logging into the videoconferencing software. This led to a delay in starting sessions; however, this issue was always easily resolved via telephone calls with the treating clinician. Additionally, the telepsychotherapy video feed occasionally became pixilated for several seconds when using a Wi-Fi-based Internet connection, but this was resolved by utilizing a direct Ethernet connection. More difficulty was encountered when utilizing cellular data-enabled iPads in rural locations. In several cases the video feed frequently became pixilated or froze and the sound and/or video were lost. These issues were often resolved by having the patient move to a different location with a better signal (provided that location was private). In one case the cellular data connection was too poor to adequately provide home-based treatment and thus the child was transitioned to school-based sessions. In general, though, the telepsychotherapy equipment worked adequately for its intended purpose and rarely necessitated accessing backup telephone procedures. The provision of simple, standardized troubleshooting guides and step-by-step, written reminders of instructions for accessing video connections likely also helped facilitate reduction of errors.Quantitative ResultsInitial comparison of groupsDemographics, baseline symptoms levels, and number of sessions completed were investigated across the two main treatment settings (school and patient home, excluding the two participants who received services in both). As expected, Mann–Whitney tests revealed no group differences in gender (p = .61), race (p = .88), or language preference (p = .78 and 0.53 for child and parent, respectively). Similarly, t tests comparing baseline measures revealed no differences in patient age (p = .55) or baseline symptom levels on the UCLA-PTSD-RI (p = .80 for child; p = .11 for parent) and SMFQ (p = .92 for child; p = .71 for parent) comparing school and home treatment settings. Additionally, neither group differed in terms of the number of sessions completed over the course of the study (p = .88). Given the lack of significant differences as a function of treatment setting, all analyses that follow were conducted considering the entire sample as a whole (see Table 1TABLES AND FIGUREStable/figure thumbnailTable 1. Outcome ScoresView larger image > in this page > in new window> Download slidefor summary data).Service provisionSchool-based telepsychotherapy services were provided to 44 youth and home-based for another 24. Two additional youth began treatment in the school-based setting but later transitioned to home-based sessions after moving schools and no longer having availability of adequate resources at school. Assessment and treatment were provided in English or Spanish according to the stated preference of participants. Services were provided in English for 46 youth and Spanish for 24, whereas caregivers received Spanish-language sessions in 40 cases and English in 30.Clinical outcomesAt baseline, 51.4% of children (n = 36) scored above the relevant clinical cutoff on the UCLA-PTSD-RI (accounting for the version of the scale implemented). By the completion of treatment, however, only 4.3% scored above clinical cutoffs (n = 3). A similar trend was noted in parent report on the UCLA-PTSD-RI, wherein 28.5% (n = 20) indicated clinical elevation at baseline but none did by the end of treatment. Examination of mean scores for both versions of the instrument are given at pre-, mid-, and posttreatment in Table 1. Comparisons of pre- and posttreatment child-reported scores indicated significant differences on both the DSM–IV, t(40) = 14.12; p < .0001; d = 2.42 and DSM–5 versions, t(17) = 8.90; p < .0001; d = 2.04. Findings comparing parent-reported data were similar, DSM–IV, t(36) = 9.19; p < .0001; d = 1.68; DSM–5, t(16) = 6.09; p < .0001; d = 1.50.As can be seen in Table 1, baseline child and parent reports on the SMFQ indicated mean levels that were above the established clinical cutoff score. By the completion of treatment, however, these scores had decreased precipitously such that average symptom levels were no longer problematic. Comparing baseline to posttreatment scores for children, t(57) = 9.27; p < .0001; d = 1.24, and parents, t(51) = 6.34; p < .0001; d = 1.21, indicated that this difference was statistically significant in both cases. The aforementioned variables were also compared in a series of 2 (Group; school or home) × 2 (Time; pre- or posttreatment) analyses of variance. These results were nonsignificant (all values between 0.37 and 0.81), indicating that within-group changes were consistent regardless of the setting in which treatment occurred.As outlined above, all participants met criteria at baseline for a trauma- or adjustment-related disorder, with 60 of 70 participants having a primary diagnosis of PTSD. By the end of treatment 54 participants (77.1%) were diagnosis-free and another seven (10.0%) retained primary diagnoses that were not related to trauma. Only two cases continued to meet criteria for PTSD by the endpoint assessment, and both evidenced substantial changes in self-reported posttraumatic symptoms on the UCLA-PTSD-RI (decrease from 72 to 42 for one participant and 46 to 26 for the other).DiscussionThe world is currently undergoing an unprecedented global pandemic with COVID-19 that has highlighted the pressing need for evidence-based telehealth service delivery models of mental health services. Stress is increased for many caregivers and children due to things such as social isolation and economic instability. There is the potential for increase in PTSD and other stress-related disorders in children, particularly children of caregivers at elevated risk for exposure, including health care providers, first responders, grocery store and sanitation workers, and so forth. The present open pilot trial of TF-CBT offers one of the first evaluations of the use of telepsychotherapy to remotely deliver TF-CBT in community-based locations, and findings supported the preliminary feasibility and effectiveness of this novel treatment delivery format with trauma-exposed children and adolescents. The present findings add to a growing body of literature supporting telepsychotherapy for expanding the reach of evidence-based mental health treatments for youth (e.g., Comer, Furr, Kerns, et al., 2017; Comer, Furr, Miguel, et al., 2017; Cooper-Vince, Chou, Furr, Puliafico, & Comer, 2016; Doss, Feinberg, Rothman, Roddy, & Comer, 2017; Gloff et al., 2015; Nelson et al., 2003; Sibley, Comer, & Gonzalez, 2017). Although recent research has supported the efficacy of telepsychotherapy delivery of a variety of interventions for children, the literature has focused very little on childhood PTSD. The preliminary feasibility and positive treatment outcome of telepsychotherapy-delivered TF-CBT observed in this pilot evaluation are promising. Close to nine out of every 10 youth (88.6%) completed a full course of telehealth delivered TF-CBT, and 96.8% of these treatment completers no longer met diagnostic criteria for a trauma-related disorder at posttreatment. Although 2.9% (or two individuals) did not exhibit full treatment response, both youths showed substantial treatment response in the form of symptom reduction (albeit not to the extent of full diagnostic remission). Although this pilot evaluation was, by design, underpowered and not methodologically geared to test formal efficacy (see Gallo, Comer, & Barlow, 2013; Kraemer, Mintz, Noda, Tinklenberg, & Yesavage, 2006), there was nonetheless preliminary indication that TF-CBT delivered via telepsychotherapy yielded a favorable clinical response from both youth and caregiver perspectives.Although the present pilot study did not include a comparison condition in which youth were treated in a clinic-based setting, the findings are promising in showing treatment effects that are comparable with TF-CBT delivered in an in-person, office-based setting (Rubin, Washburn, & Schieszler, 2017). Considering that attrition from office-based TF-CBT treatment remains a significant concern (e.g., approximately 25–50%; Cohen, Mannarino, & Iyengar, 2011; Olfson et al., 2009; Scheeringa, Weems, Cohen, Amaya-Jackson, & Guthrie, 2011), the rate of 11.4% for the current study is encouraging. Reduction in barriers to accessing care that the use of telepsychotherapy technology affords (e.g., reduced need for caregivers to take time off from work; find transportation/gas money to reach our clinic; drive long distances to appointments), as well as the availability of linguistically competent clinicians, may have contributed to the high treatment completion rates and the concomitant reductions in clinical symptoms. In particular, it is important to note that our program also utilized additional engagement strategies (Gopalan et al., 2010; McKay & Bannon, 2004), such as using reminder phone calls and text messages, directly addressing caregiver concerns and barriers at the time of the initial appointment and throughout treatment, and addressing beliefs and attitudes related to mental health treatment. These engagement strategies may have decreased treatment attrition beyond what would be seen if we had used the telepsychotherapy delivery model without these additional engagement strategies. While the lack of treatment attrition in the present study is very encouraging, future controlled studies will be needed to directly compare attrition rates for the telepsychotherapy versus in-person treatment modalities.Additionally, future studies investigating the sustainability of telepsychotherapy models are important to further development of this modality of treatment. This becomes an especially important aspect of future research given the global pandemic outbreak of COVID-19 and subsequent rapid adjustment to most mental health services now being offered through telepsychotherapy connections (whether or not providers, agencies, or service delivery systems were ready to do so). For example, individual states are increasingly mandating coverage for telepsychotherapy (American Telemedicine Association, 2017; Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, 2019) and third-party payers are improving reimbursement for real-time telehealth services (American Medical Association, 2019; Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, 2018; Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, 2020b). The recent COVID-19 pandemic has also resulted in temporary federal mandates for Medicare to reimburse telepsychotherapy services offered by psychologists and other mental health providers without regard for previous restrictions regarding rural locations (Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, 2020b). Additionally, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has temporarily relaxed Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act compliance regulations for virtual platform use in an effort to increase the reach of services during this global crisis (U.S. Department of Health & Human Services, 2020). Psychiatric services (e.g., medication management) provided via telehealth were significantly more likely to be reimbursed prior to the COVID-19 pandemic than psychotherapies (e.g., TF-CBT) delivered via telehealth, particularly by federal and state programs (American Telemedicine Association, 2017; Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, 2020a), partially due to their greater ease of integration into primary care or other approved originating environments previously necessary to adhere to CMS rules. The steps taken to increase reimbursement for telepsychotherapy services during the current global pandemic may be the first step in paving the way for sustainability of these services in the future. Further work to establish the effectiveness of delivering trauma-focused treatment for youth through telepsychotherapy could promote sustainability of these interventions that can help to reduce the burden of suffering for families who are underserved by typical office-based models of care (Kazdin & Blasé, 2011).The present pilot study provides preliminary evidence of the ability to successfully deliver TF-CBT via telepsychotherapy technology, resulting in clinically meaningful symptom change posttreatment with low treatment attrition (11.4% dropout) among trauma-exposed children and adolescents ages 7–18. Additionally, the ethnic and language diversity of the sample (58.6% Hispanic, 30.0% African American; 34.3% of children and 57.1% of parents requesting Spanish-language materials and services) provide important preliminary evidence of TF-CBT effectiveness with a more representative sample of trauma-exposed youth in the United States, which may have applicability to other global settings (e.g., Central and Latin America). Nevertheless, additional efforts are still needed to further establish the empirical base for telepsychotherapy delivery of trauma-focused treatment for youth.Limitations of the present study include the small sample size and primarily female sample, which may reduce the generalizability of the study results. The lack of a comparison group and randomization are also problematic in terms predicting the applicability of results in other environments, which would suggest the need for noninferiority studies similar to those seen among adult veteran populations (e.g., Acierno et al., 2016). Treatment fidelity was also only informally assessed during weekly supervision, but more formal measures would have been useful. Additionally, TOP was potentially somewhat atypical in that the program was able to provide iPads and Internet access to patients who would otherwise not have been able to access these resources (thus precluding their participation in treatment). Cost-effectiveness analysis and careful attention to resource acquisition would be useful to examine the feasibility of this strategy in future work in usual care settings. Organizations will need to think creatively to address these barriers, such as obtaining grant or other funding to provide these resources for needy families, as some school districts are doing currently for schooling in the midst of national quarantine restrictions on school attendance.Despite these limitations, program evaluation of applied service delivery environments are critical for pilot testing novel treatment formats that may be useful in supporting future randomized inquiries (Gallo et al., 2013; Kraemer et al., 2006). The present findings are among the first to provide evidence in support of the preliminary feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness of telehealth TF-CBT for youth presenting with trauma-related disorders (i.e., PTSD, adjustment disorder, other specified trauma and stressor related disorder). The COVID-19 global pandemic has resulted in an unprecedented need to rethink how mental health services are delivered, which is particularly applicable to high base rate conditions related to posttraumatic stress. In an effort to protect the public, thousands of mental health providers and patients have been advised to transition to a telepsychotherapy delivery format. Telepsychotherapy offers many benefits over traditional face-to-face psychotherapy service delivery models including (a) reduction of barriers in access to care (e.g., distance to clinic, lack of transportation, cost of gas and parking, work schedules, childcare), (b) increased likelihood of adequate treatment dose and completion (by way of reducing the aforementioned barriers), and, more recently, (c) protecting the public amid a global crisis that requires physical distancing and potentially relative social isolation. Having started this clinic five years ago, our team was well suited to assist teams across the United States and the world in transitioning their own services to a telepsychotherapy format, which was fortuitous as the need to do so arose for essentially the entire field at once. We have now trained providers across child advocacy centers, academic medical centers, university clinics, and independent practice environments. Given the existing network of nationally certified TF-CBT therapists (https://tfcbt.org), and many international TF-CBT therapists, these findings suggest the potential for providing effective and accessible telepsychotherapy intervention during this public health crisis (as well as those that will occur in the future). It will be imperative to present empirical evidence for the feasibility and potential effectiveness of delivering psychotherapy for children and adolescents via telepsychotherapy to legislators and policymakers to ensure sustained reimbursement and expansion of this method. If the COVID-19 pandemic has taught us anything about health care service delivery thus far, it is that the entire American system was ill prepared to adapt to such a crisis. Future work to develop new clinical and technical infrastructures, public policies, and methods of reimbursement is imperative to ensuring that this crisis results in an opportunity to improve service delivery to those in need. Stress is common in agricultural occupations. With the use of heavy machinery and dangerous tools, farming is one of the most hazardous occupations (Freeman, Schwab, & Jiang, 2008). Physical health may be compromised through the use of pesticides and other chemicals, resulting in acute or chronic effects on the nervous, respiratory, immune, endocrine, and/or reproductive systems (Blair, Ritz, Wesseling, & Beane Freeman, 2015). In addition to physical stressors, farm-related tasks, external factors, and interpersonal stressors increase the vulnerability of farmers to mental health concerns (Lunner Kolstrup et al., 2013; Onwuameze, Paradiso, Peek-Asa, Donham, & Rautiainen, 2013). Farm-related tasks include long days, isolation, heavy workload, technological innovation, business management, and farm administration. External factors, such as disease outbreaks, natural disasters, government regulations, climate changes, and market fluctuations, are unpredictable. Finally, interpersonal stressors related to family roles (e.g., family caregiving, conflict, divorce, and spouse’s employment off the farm) have the potential to increase stress (Hovey & Seligman, 2006). With the risk of injury and exposure to chemicals, combined with family pressures and long hours, farmers and ranchers may have a higher risk of developing mental health illnesses (Fraser et al., 2005).The impact of stress on the mental health of farmers is a growing concern. Prevalence rates of depression in agricultural workers in the Midwest have varied from 7.4% to 24% (Onwuameze et al., 2013). Farming is an occupation with a higher suicide rate than the general population (Behere & Bhise, 2009), and gender differences exist, as rural men evidence higher suicide rates than rural women in most countries (Sauvaget et al., 2009). In addition to poor mental health outcomes, farmers have an increased prevalence of chronic health conditions, including cardiovascular and respiratory disease, arthritis, and skin cancer (Kirkhorn & Schenker, 2002).Exacerbating farmers’ mental health concerns is the reluctance to seeking treatment. Farmers are hesitant to acknowledge struggles with mental health, and a negative stigma exists regarding seeking mental health treatment (Judd et al., 2006). Additionally, farm families may live in isolated geographic locations in which seeking mental health treatment is not possible, as rural communities are limited in the availability of mental health services (Gray, 2011). Because of a lack of mental health providers, rural residents tend to receive medication instead of psychotherapy (Richardson, Lewis, Casey-Goldstein, McCauley, & Katon, 2007).Social Support as a Protective FactorSocial support increases overall health and well-being (Berkman, Glass, Brissette, & Seeman, 2000; Cohen, 2004) by serving as a buffer against the adverse effects of work demands (Logstein, 2016). Social support also serves as a protective factor against psychological distress (Caxaj, 2016; Compton, Thompson, & Kaslow, 2005; Turvey, Stromquist, Kelly, Zwerling, & Merchant, 2002); however, limited studies have examined social support as a protective factor in the development of depressive symptoms in farmers (Turvey et al., 2002). In a sample of 99 male Australian farmers, social support and a sense of belonging decreased the relationship between depressive symptoms and suicidal ideations (McLaren & Challis, 2009). Turvey et al. (2002) found similar results with a sample of rural individuals, in which lack of frequent contact with family, friends, or groups was strongly associated with suicidal ideations.Social networks involve a social structure in which individuals engage in close personal relationships and interactions. The quality of social support offered by social networks is important to consider, as individuals with low quality of relationships may have more than double the risk of depression (Teo, Choi, & Valenstein, 2013). In addition to the quality of relationships, different sources of social support may be more beneficial than others when protecting against mental health symptoms (Smith et al., 2013). For example, trust is an important factor in determining with whom farmers will share personal matters (Roy, Tremblay, & Robertson, 2014). Farmers tend to rely upon family members, other farmers, and friends for support with mental health issues rather than professionals (Judd et al., 2006).The majority of the research on the mental health of farmers, including suicide risk, has occurred in Australia (Scheyett, Bayakly, & Whitaker, 2019). Little knowledge exists regarding social support as a protective factor in the development of depressive symptoms in farmers and the types of social support (significant other, family, friend) that would most benefit farmers in the United States. To fill this gap, the current study addressed two research questions: (a) What is the relationship between depression and social support in U.S. farmers?; and (b) Do different types of social support relate to depression in this group?MethodFarmers completed an online survey that included demographic questions and two measures: the Major Depression Inventory (MDI; Olsen, Jensen, Noerholm, Martiny, & Bech, 2003) and the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS; Zimet, Dahlem, Zimet, & Farley, 1988). Demographic information obtained included gender, age, marital status, number of children, race/ethnicity, military status, state of residence, length of time in occupation, and type of operation. Farmers were also asked to specify who they would reach out to if they were faced with a challenging situation (e.g., family, friend, medical provider, pastor/priest, counselor).Participants and ProcedureThe land-grant university Cooperative Extension System provides outreach services for communities across each state. Cooperative Extension personnel throughout one Midwestern state distributed information regarding the online survey through multiple methods, including e-mail distribution lists to producers and direct interactions at farming events during the summer and winter months. Farmers were required to be over the age of 18 and engage in farming or ranching at least part time to qualify for participation in the study. A $10.00 gift card incentive was provided to participants who completed the survey. The study’s protocol was reviewed and approved by all relevant institutional review boards.MeasuresThe MDI (Olsen et al., 2003) is a 12-item self-report questionnaire intended to measure the presence of major depression according to the algorithm of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 4th edition; DSM-IV (American Psychiatric Association, 1994) and the severity of depressive symptoms, with a range of 0 to 50. The instrument inquires about depressive symptoms during the past 2 weeks and uses a Likert scale from 0 (at no time) to 5 (all the time). The MDI has adequate internal validity as a unidimensional scale, and when used as an index of diagnostic validity, has a sensitivity of 82% for DSM–IV major depression (Olsen et al., 2003). The internal consistency in the current sample was very high (α = .91).The MSPSS (Zimet et al., 1988) is a brief 12-item self-report measure that assesses perceived social support from three subscales: Family, Friends, and Significant Other. The items are scored on a 7-point Likert scale, ranging from 1 (very strongly disagree) to 7 (very strongly agree; Zimet et al., 1988). The MSPSS has demonstrated strong factorial validity and internal consistency reliability across varying groups (Canty-Mitchell & Zimet, 2000; Stanley, Beck, & Zebb, 1998; Zimet, Powell, Farley, Werkman, & Berkoff, 1990), and has strong factorial validity confirming the three subscales (Zimet et al., 1990). The internal consistency in the current sample was high for overall social support (α = .97) as well as the Significant Other (α = .95), Family (α = .94), and Friend subscales (α = .96). Overall, the MSPSS is widely used to measure perceived sources of social support (Osman, Lamis, Freedenthal, Gutierrez, & McNaughton-Cassill, 2014).Statistical AnalysisMean MDI and MSPSS scores were compared between men and women using an independent-samples t test, with α = .05. Due to the skewed distribution of MDI scores, a square root transformation was applied to MDI scores prior to analysis. Using bivariate linear regression, each predictor variable was initially screened for significance against MDI score. All variables that reached significance at α = .1 were then tested in a multivariate model. The initial multivariate model included military service, gender, Significant Other subscale, Family subscale, and Friend subscale. Variables that did not remain significant in the multivariate model were removed individually. Once all variables in the model were significant at α = .05, the variables that were previously removed were tested in the final model. Variance inflation factors (VIFs) were calculated for each model, and a cutoff of 5 was used with these models due to the potential for multicollinearity among support scales. However, all VIFs were below 4 and therefore did not meet the threshold of 5 that we had set for multicollinearity. Moderating effects of gender and military service on the social support subscales were tested using Gender × Subscale and Military Service × Subscale interactions. Final data are reported as beta coefficients and p values derived from square-root-transformed outcome variables.ResultsDemographic CharacteristicsParticipants were 172 farmers and ranchers from five Midwestern states (106 men, 65 women; one did not report their gender). Slightly more than half of participants were in middle adulthood, as 26.3% (n = 45) were between 45 and 54 years of age, and 24% (n = 41) were between 55 and 64 years of age. The majority of participants were married (n = 152, 88.4%), and 61.3% (n = 103) had children who helped on the farm or ranch. Most (n = 123, 71.5%) reported a secondary source of income off the farm, whereas 28.5% (n = 49) reported that farming or ranching was their primary source of income, with no income off of the farm.Participants specified to whom they would reach out to if faced with a challenging situation. Most of the farmers would turn to a family member (n = 150, 87.2%) or a friend (n = 118, 68.6%) for support. A little over one third of farmers (n = 62, 36.0%) would seek out a pastor, and 19.8% (n = 34) would talk to a doctor. Only 21 farmers (12.2%) reported that they would seek support from a counselor.Risk Factors for DepressionAccording to the MDI, a score between 20 to 24 indicates mild depression, a score of 25 to 29 indicates moderate depression, and a score of 30 or more indicates severe depression. Most farmers reported a score below 20 (n = 157; 91.3%), whereas 8.7% (n = 15) had scores that were in a depression range. Nine farmers scored between 20 to 24 for mild depression, three scored between 25 to 29 for moderate depression, and three reported a score greater than or equal to 30 for severe depression. There were no significant differences in the depression scores for men and women.On the MSPSS, a mean score from 1 to 2.9 indicates low support, 3 to 5 suggests medium support, and 5.1 to 7 is considered high support. Over 76.2% of farmers and ranchers (n = 131) reported high support from significant others, 74.4% (n = 128) reported high support from family members, and 68.6% (n = 118) reported high support from friends. Overall, no significant differences existed between men and women on the subscales or total mean score for social support.Higher scores on the MSPSS subscales and the total score were all associated with lower MDI scores. In the final model, the Friend subscale (β = 0.22, p = .02) remained significant, and the Family subscale indicated a trend toward significance (β = 0.17, p = .08). There were no significant Gender × Support interaction effects on MDI scores for significant other (p = .97), family (p = .75), and friend (p = .97). Similarly, there were no significant Military Service × Support interaction effects on MDI scores for significant other (p = .97), family (p = .97), and friend (p = .90).

Although the MDI was not used to make a clinical diagnosis, the results suggested a similar prevalence of depressive symptoms as other recent studies, in which estimates have ranged from 7.4% to 24% in Midwestern farmers (Onwuameze et al., 2013). Additionally, only 21 farmers reported a willingness to seek counseling services if struggling with a mental health concern. Farmers may tend to ignore both physical and mental health symptoms unless their work productivity is reduced (Hull, Fennell, Vallury, Jones, & Dollman, 2017). Reluctance to seeking treatment from a mental health provider may also demonstrate the pervasive mental health stigma within agriculture, lower mental health literacy, and the lack of accessibility of mental health services in rural areas. Common structural barriers to mental health care that have been reported include a shortage of mental health providers in rural areas (Fuller, Edwards, Martinez, Edwards, & Reid, 2004) and long waiting times for services (Sturm & Sherbourne, 2001).To increase services to rural farmers, telemental health, which involves providing mental health assessment and treatment remotely, can increase access to efficacious treatments (Hilty et al., 2013). Telemental health has been found to be effective for diagnosis and assessments in adults (Hilty et al., 2013); however, more research is needed to determine the willingness of farmers to access telemental health services and the effectiveness of the care. In addition to increasing access to mental health care, mental health clinicians may also improve communication with farmers by receiving training on the context of farm life to acquire a greater understanding of the physical stressors, farm-related tasks, external factors, and interpersonal stressors farmers experience daily (Hull et al., 2017).Farmers completed the MSPSS to measure perceived social support in three areas: family, friends, and significant other. Low social support scores on the MSPSS in the subscales as well as the total mean score were significantly related to higher depression scores on the MDI, which indicates that as social support decreases, depressive symptoms increase. Furthermore, low support from friends and family appeared to be the most significant risk factors for higher depression scores after controlling for age, gender, military service, and significant-other support.Social support is one of the most essential functions provided by a family (Gardner & Cutrona, 2004). Family relationships within a farming context can be complex, as farming is a unique occupation in which work and home life are intertwined. Often, farming involves multiple generations living in close proximity to one another (Swisher, Elder, Lorenz, & Conger, 1998). Although this closeness offers opportunities for social support, blurred boundaries within roles, tasks, responsibilities, and expectations may exist, resulting in lack of communication and increased conflict among family members (Fraser et al., 2005).Passing ownership of the farm from one family member to the next is one of the most pertinent issues that can create role confusion and conflict. Patrilineal inheritance is a common strategy for keeping the farm within the family (Macken-Walsh & Byrne, 2015). This strategy can be crucial for the economic performance and sustainability of the farm (Cush & Macken-Walsh, 2016). However, farmers tend to retire at a later age (Franklin, Mitchell, Driscoll, & Fragar, 2001), resulting in the male heirs becoming dependent on their parents for a longer duration than nonfarming peers. When passing ownership of the family farm is delayed, the younger generation often struggles with identity issues due to a desire to be autonomous (Fraser et al., 2005). The identity issues and role confusion may contribute to conflict and a disconnection within the parent–child relationship, possibly resulting in lower levels of perceived social support by either family member.In addition to blurred boundaries with family roles and expectations, family communication patterns can influence the method in which one seeks social support. By observing interactions among family members, communication patterns are learned and applied within relationships (Koerner & Cvancara, 2002). Communication patterns related to seeking social support can be direct or indirect. Direct support seeking involves an explicit desire and request for help, including discussing problems and/or feelings while openly displaying one’s emotions (Barbee & Cunningham, 1995). Conversely, indirect support seeking involves minimizing feelings or issues, avoiding specific topics, and trying to hide distress (Goldsmith, 1995). Indirect requests for social support may result in a lack of awareness by the receiver that support is desired. As a result, the receiver is perceived as unaccepting of the request for help. Indirect support seeking, such as lack of openness and topic avoidance, has been associated with less satisfaction and increased distress in relationships (Sargent, 2002). Because of the limited empirical work on help-seeking perceptions and behaviors among farmers (Roy et al., 2014), future research may explore the communication patterns (direct or indirect) for seeking social support within farm families.Communication patterns are also important when establishing and sustaining friendships. Farmers with low friend support may lack the resources to initiate relationships or connect with friends. Strong interpersonal skills are important when establishing networks of social support. Individuals with strong communication skills tend to report increased feelings of happiness and higher levels of self-esteem (Demir, Jaafar, Bilyk, & Mohd Ariff, 2012). Conversely, individuals with poor social skills are at a higher risk of developing psychological distress, because they lack the protective effects of social support (Segrin, McNelis, & Swiatkowski, 2016). Perhaps the farmers who lack social support may be limited in the interpersonal skills necessary to initiate and maintain relationships, which contributes to symptoms of depression. Future research may explore the interpersonal communication styles of farmers and how those styles relate to developing social relationships.Finally, agrarian beliefs influence communication styles and help-seeking behaviors in farm families. The agrarian way of life typically involves pride, physical strength, heavy labor, ruggedness, and self-sacrifice (Bryant & Garnham, 2015). Societal norms on masculinity, such as the avoidance of showing emotion and/or vulnerability, the importance of autonomy, and the ability to take risks contribute to negative attitudes and beliefs toward seeking help from others (Hogan, Scarr, Lockie, Chant, & Alston, 2012). With the social norms of rural masculinity, seeking help may be viewed as unmanly (Roy et al., 2014), which may hinder farmers from discussing and responding to emotional concerns with friends or family members. The lack of openness to discuss problems may limit the opportunities to seek and receive social support.LimitationsBecause the current study used self-report measures, a response bias may have been present. Social desirability refers to the tendency to report symptoms in a favorable manner to gain social approval (King & Bruner, 2000). This tendency is more likely to occur with questions that are socially sensitive, such as mental health questionnaires or interviews (King & Bruner, 2000; Phillips & Clancy, 1970). The depression rate in the current sample was similar to reported rates in the literature; however, symptoms may have been underreported. A social desirability scale may be helpful in future surveys to control for this form of response bias.Farmers were recruited to participate in the study via Cooperative Extension e-mail list serves and farming events, which may limit the generalizability of the results. Considering that Cooperative Extension personnel shared the survey with farmers, the level of perceived social support may have been higher due to an affiliation with Cooperative Extension programming. Additionally, because the current study did not utilize random sampling procedures, representation of the larger farming population may not have been achieved. Future studies employing random sampling procedures would strengthen the methodology by eliminating sampling bias and ensuring the sample represents the target population. Finally, the study used a cross-sectional design and, as such, no cause–effect inferences can be made.ImplicationsThe current study contributes to a greater understanding of the role of social support as a protective factor on depressive symptoms in farmers in the United States. The results highlight the importance of friend and family support and the need to explore family dynamics (e.g., roles, rules, boundaries, expectations) and communication patterns unique to farm families that may contribute to resiliency and protect against depressive symptoms. Additionally, efforts to increase mental health literacy may reduce stigma and improve help-seeking behaviors.Considering farmers tend to disclose to individuals they trust, it is important for mental health providers to understand the context of farming and the stressors that occur within the occupation. By attending training or professional development opportunities, mental health professionals would acquire a better understanding of farm stress that could enhance rapport. Additionally, due to time constraints in farming and the structural barriers related to accessing mental health care in rural areas, traditional face-to-face counseling may not be practical. Telemental health may provide an alternative approach to reaching farmers who are live in remote locations. Couples and families experience relationship and family distress at an alarming rate, with up to one third of couples reporting distress at a given time, and nearly 40% of marriages in the United States ending in divorce (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2015; Whisman, Beach, & Snyder, 2008). Relationship distress is associated with increased risk of mental and physical health problems, including depression, anxiety, substance use, and cardiovascular and immune diseases (Robles, Slatcher, Trombello, & McGinn, 2014). Despite the prevalence and negative impact of relationship distress, few couples seek professional help for relationship problems. In lieu of couple therapy, the majority of couples turn to self-help books or relationship workshops (Stewart, Bradford, Higginbotham, & Skogrand, 2016), and those who do seek couple therapy most frequently do so with a religious leader or organization (Doss, Rhoades, Stanley, & Markman, 2009). Moreover, nearly one in five children and adolescents experience mental illness, with the most common diagnoses being disruptive behavior disorders, mood disorders, anxiety disorders, and developmental disorders (Olfson, Blanco, Wang, Laje, & Correll, 2014). Despite the prevalence of childhood problems, geographic barriers to care, mental health stigma, and lack of financial resources prevent many from seeking and/or accessing help (Mukolo, Heflinger, & Wallston, 2010).Technology Can Be Leveraged to Increase the Reach of Services for Couples and FamiliesTechnological advances provide tremendous opportunities for couple and family services to overcome common barriers to treatment seeking and improve cost effectiveness.Reduced BarriersFirst, technology can be harnessed to overcome logistical barriers and provide unfettered access to services at the pace, schedule, and preference of the client. The most commonly discussed benefit of technology use in psychological interventions is its potential to transcend the confines of geography (Nelson & Bui, 2010) and extend the reach of psychological services (Comer & Barlow, 2014). The majority of mental health services are concentrated in major metropolitan regions and academic hubs. As a result, a sizable proportion of United States countries—especially rural and remote communities—do not have a mental health provider specializing in youth, family, or relationship interventions (National Organization of State Offices of Rural Health, 2011). In contrast, 77% of adults in the United States own a smartphone and 73% have broadband access at home; in rural areas of the United States, the comparable numbers are 67% and 63%, respectively (Smith, 2017).Improved Cost EffectivenessFinancial burdens associated with mental health care often reduce or prevent access to mental health treatment (Sareen et al., 2007). Financial barriers are especially acute for treatments of relationship or family distress because insurance companies often do not reimburse for couple therapy or family interventions not focused on a child’s diagnosis. Technology can seemingly be used to overcome these financial barriers, although the issue has received scant empirical attention. For clients, technology can reduce transportation, parking, and childcare costs that are often associated with clinic-based treatment (Smit et al., 2006). Technology may also reduce costs for providers, as brick-and-mortar therapy rooms are not required. Moreover, most of the costs of automated or asynchronous applications are incurred up front, with little added costs associated with each additional couple or family served (e.g., Georgia, Rothman, Roddy, & Doss, 2017).Importance of Technology for Family and Couple InterventionsIntegration of technology into interventions may be particularly useful for the unique needs and circumstances of couples and families. First, couple and family interventions come with unique barriers to access to care. Treatment involving multiple participants requires coordination of multiple schedules and costs associated with multiple people missing work or school. Couple and family treatment also requires engagement of more clients with different priorities or goals. Unfortunately, unwillingness of family members to attend therapy sessions contributes to nonengagement in therapy (Wang et al., 2006).Second, technology can reduce the stigma of face-to-face family and couple interventions—especially among men and children. Stigma significantly predicts likelihood of seeking mental health services, with higher self-stigma associated with fewer services sought (Lannin, Vogel, Brenner, Abraham, & Heath, 2016). Men are more likely than women to be reluctant about entering in-person couple therapy (Doss, Atkins, & Christensen, 2003). Moreover, children who are less willing to participate in in-person treatments show poorer treatment outcomes (Karver, Handelsman, Fields, & Bickman, 2006).Types of Technologically-Supported InterventionsIn broad strokes, the application of technology to enhance, supplement, or replace in-person mental health interventions can be grouped into two categories: telemental health interventions and behavioral intervention technologies (BITs). Telemental health interventions refer to services that leverage videoconferencing media platforms to facilitate real-time interactions for the provision of mental health care that is traditionally delivered in person (American Telemedicine Association, 2017). BITs include applications of technology that are used to augment in-person treatments (e.g., an app to remind clients of homework assignments or track thoughts/behaviors) or provide self-help interventions without formal in-person treatment (e.g., an online program, with or without coach support). As these applications of technology differ in important ways, we cover each separately in this paper. For both telemental health and BITs, we will present recommendations for design and implementation, recruitment, and evaluation of these technologies. Throughout, we will draw from an extensive body of research that has been conducted on applications of technology for individual disorders (e.g., Marsch, Lord, & Dallery, 2014) and, where available, from the couple and family literature.Telemental Health InterventionsThe key distinguishing feature of telemental health is the use of synchronous interactive telecommunication technologies to enable providers to remotely deliver real-time services. However, telemental health interventions can additionally incorporate asynchronous store-and-forward communications between clients and providers (as well as related BITs). Across health care disciplines, mental health care may be particularly amenable to videoconferencing-based delivery, given that mental health care relies heavily on both verbal and nonverbal communication. Videoconferencing platforms now afford very high quality, simultaneous, two-way audio and video transmissions. Accordingly, clinical interest in telemental health interventions for children, couples, and families, as well as focused research evaluating the potential of such programs, have sharply increased in recent years (e.g., Comer, Furr, Kerns, et al., 2017; Comer, Furr, Miguel, et al., 2017; Myers, Vander Stoep, Zhou, McCarty, & Katon, 2015; Vander Stoep et al., 2017). For example, Internet-delivered parent-child interaction therapy (I-PCIT; Comer et al., 2015) uses videoconferencing to deliver parent training to families in their own homes; the family uses a webcam to stream family interactions to a therapist who remotely coaches parents through a parent-worn Bluetooth earpiece. Delivering treatment in consumers’ own homes or natural settings increases the ecological validity of interventions for couples and families. For example, in parent training, having the child in his or her typical setting may increase the chances that the child responds in typical ways, providing more representative challenges for the parent and therapist to work through, and facilitating direct opportunities for generalization of treatment gains. Indeed, a recent randomized controlled evaluation found a significantly higher rate of excellent responders among families treated with I-PCIT relative to families treated with clinic-based PCIT (Comer, Furr, Miguel, et al., 2017).How Does One Design and Implement a Telemental Health Intervention?Matters of security, confidentiality, comfort, engagement, and reimbursement are critical to consider when designing and implementing telemental health couple and family interventions.Videoconferencing platformsVideoconference platforms can be lumped into two main categories: standards-based or consumer-grade applications. Standards-based videoconferencing systems involve point-to-point transmission, using an application that is installed on the computer of both the provider and the client. Standards-based point-to-point applications allow for firewalls, encrypted communication, and, in general, a highly secure interface. In general, nothing offers higher quality and security than T-1 and T-3 line connections, which provide point-to-point transmissions that do not go over the public Internet. However, T-1 and T-3 line connections, and related standards-based systems, are very expensive and can require considerable maintenance. As such, standards-based systems can be cost prohibitive for many providers and health care systems, particularly when telemental health interventions are delivered from one site to multiple locations (e.g., individual client homes) rather than to a single site (e.g., one primary care office in a rural community). More affordable and practical consumer-grade alternatives transmit communications over the public Internet from one Internet protocol (IP) address to another, albeit with relatively slower speeds and somewhat reduced security. Many consumer-grade videoconferencing platforms (e.g., VSee) also offer screen-sharing features that allow providers and clients to easily exchange images, progress graphs, or questionnaires, or to remotely collaborate on documents, in real time.When using a consumer-grade videoconferencing platform, it is critical that the provider confirm that any videoconferencing platform selected: (a) does not store or retain any session information on its network after sessions are complete, (b) allows users to host meetings that are unlisted and requires the host to invite all attendees, (c) requires identification of all meeting attendants, (d) requires all meeting attendants use a strong password to log in, (e) requires approval of “Forgot Password” requests, and (f) uses the advanced encryption standards or comparable algorithm and a secure encryption tunnel (see Chou, Comer, Turvey, Karr, & Spargo, 2016 for further discussion). While several such consumer-grade platforms are available, VSee is a leading provider this is relatively affordable and easy to use.When selecting appropriate videoconferencing software, the most affordable options are free services, such as Skype, but such platforms offer somewhat poorer audio and video quality than other options (e.g., more disrupted or dropped calls), and importantly they often store and retain meeting data, which raises concerns about privacy and confidentiality. As such, we do not recommend free videoconferencing services, such as Skype, for delivery of telemental health services. Additionally, we recommend that providers and clients use password-protected computing devices (rather than mobile devices) and utilize Ethernet cords (not wireless connections).HardwareAt a minimum, couple and family telemental health interventions typically require a computing device with online connectivity, webcam, and microphone at both the provider site and at the client site. Most modern-day computing devices include built-in cameras and microphones. Some telemental health programs, such as I-PCIT, entail remote bug-in-the-ear coaching and thus additionally require Bluetooth earpiece devices. Telemental health treatments that entail naturalistic observations of couples or families who may not always be facing the camera throughout the session require an omnidirectional room microphone to capture the full audio of the room, regardless of client position.Delivery settingsCouple and family telemental health sessions are often grouped into “supervised” and “unsupervised” settings. A supervised setting is one in which clinical staff (albeit not the telemental health provider) is present at the client site. An example of telemental health delivered to a supervised setting is when one is remotely providing mental health care via videoconferencing to a child while that child sits in a pediatrician’s office with a nurse, physician, and/or other health care provider on site. Studies to date of telemental health for children and families delivered to supervised settings have demonstrated strong feasibility, acceptability, efficacy, and client satisfaction (e.g., Myers et al., 2015). Telemental health with certain high-risk client populations may always need to be delivered to a supervised setting. For example, it may be inappropriate to conduct remote sessions with families with maltreatment histories in the absence of a clinical provider at the client site.It is not always feasible to deliver telemental health in supervised settings, and for some forms of couple or family telemental health it may even be preferable to deliver care to an unsupervised natural setting. Indeed, many telemental health interventions are intentionally designed to evaluate couples and families in their own homes rather than in clinic settings (e.g., I-PCIT; Comer et al., 2015; Comer, Furr, Miguel, et al., 2017). Telemental health interventions delivered to unsupervised settings are an increasingly popular telemental health strategy (Luxton, Sirotin, & Mishkind, 2010) and have demonstrated initial feasibility, safety, and efficacy in a growing number of controlled trials (e.g., Comer, Furr, Kerns, et al., 2017; Comer, Furr, Miguel, et al., 2017). However, safety concerns render telemental health treatment in unsupervised settings inappropriate for some clinical populations, a point to which we now turn.Safety planning and crisis managementUsing videoconferencing to provide remote care in unsupervised settings may be inappropriate for certain high-risk client populations (e.g., maltreating families, suicidal clients). However, clinical emergencies occur even after screening out particularly high-risk clients from telemental health practices. Prior to initiating treatment, the telemental health provider and client must develop a detailed risk management plan in the event that a crisis should occur. Telemental health providers should assess potential safety risks in the client site environment (e.g., firearms and/or household hazards). Therapists should also have a secondary way to contact the participant if technology fails in the middle of a session (e.g., a plan that the therapist will call the client’s cell phone). When telemental health is delivered to clinically supervised settings (e.g., local pediatrician’s office, community outpatient clinic, school site), local professionals must be familiar with emergency procedures. Recent telemental health guidelines (American Telemedicine Association, 2017) advise providers to always: (a) identify local emergency resources and phone numbers, (b) familiarize themselves with the location of the nearest emergency resources capable of managing mental health emergencies, and (c) store contact information for clients’ families and designated supports. During the consent process and throughout treatment, clients should be informed and reminded that in the case of an emergency or if they are unable to reach the therapist due to technology failure and require immediate assistance, they should call 911.Technological literacy and comfortTelemental health treatment progress is substantially hindered when participants do not have the knowledge to set up sessions and navigate the features of videoconferencing software. Prior to treatment, it is useful to conduct an informational session over the phone about the technological components of treatment and/or to send clients instructional manuals and troubleshooting resources. Usability is critical for the success of telemental health; interventions that are too complex for clients or for providers will not see widespread adoption and implementation. When resources allow, it is useful to have a dedicated staff member available to provide remote tech support as needed to clients during telemental health sessions. Telemental health providers should also check in frequently with clients to discuss any frustrations with technology and with treatment in general.Therapeutic alliance and engagementClinical trials evaluating couple and family telemental health find high treatment retention, client engagement, client-therapist agreement on therapeutic tasks, client-therapist agreement on therapeutic goals, and client satisfaction, as well as positive affective bonds between clients and therapists (Comer, Furr, Kerns, et al., 2017; Comer, Furr, Miguel, et al., 2017). Indeed, research consistently demonstrates alliance to be comparable across telemental health and office-based treatment modalities (Comer, Furr, Kerns, et al., 2017). These results are promising, but supplementary steps should nonetheless be taken to maintain engagement and the therapeutic alliance in videoconference-based treatment. Real-time screen-sharing activities (and interactive games when children are involved in treatment) can meaningfully increase client engagement during telemental health and enhance client understanding of session content. For example, in a study of videoconferencing-delivered, family-based treatment for early onset obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), Comer, Furr, Kerns, and colleagues (2017) created interactive computer games using Google Drawing and Google Documents that were collaboratively played in session by the child and therapist. One activity included an interactive “build a worry monster” game in which therapists and families selected cartoon monster features from an image bank to build a cartoon “Worry Monster” in order to help children externalize their OCD (Comer, Furr, et al., 2014).ReimbursementTelemental health payment issues vary widely by provider, services offered, population treated, and insurance provider. Medicaid reimbursement covers telemental health in most states (Center for Telehealth and eHealth Law, 2011) and even includes an additional “telehealth originating site facility fee.” States vary, however, as to whether they will reimburse for telemental health outside of delivery to rural or otherwise underserved regions. Unfortunately, many private payers do not currently reimburse for telemental health services; however, trends point to increasing coverage for telemental health by private insurers (Center for Telehealth and eHealth Law, 2011).How Does One Recruit for a Telemental Health Intervention?Many couple and family telemental health providers offer both clinic-based and videoconferencing-based treatment options, and their recruitment for telemental health services does not extend beyond recruitment efforts in place for clinic-based services. Accordingly, clients treated via videoconferencing are often those who initially reach out for services at a provider’s brick-and-mortar office, and then elect to participate in remote treatment options to improve the convenience of care. Broader recruitment efforts for telemental health are needed.Successful recruitment methods for telemental health have included collaboration and engagement with pediatric and primary care practices (e.g., Myers et al., 2015), school settings (Stephan, Lever, Bernstein, Edwards, & Pruitt, 2016), and juvenile justice systems (Batastini, 2016). Outreach to rural and other underserved and remote communities is particularly needed (Nelson & Bui, 2010). Given the increasing role of the Internet as the first point of contact for couples and families seeking health care resources, telemental health providers must maintain a strong web presence.Although telemental health increases opportunities to treat clients near and far, licensure and jurisdiction matters merit comment. At this time, most states require that providers be licensed in the state in which the client is receiving services (regardless of where the therapist is situated at the time of care; see Kramer, Kinn, & Mishkind, 2015 for a review of legal and regulatory issues). Although specific licensure regulations vary across states, for the most part, a telemental health provider can only deliver telemental health services to clients in states in which the provider is licensed; thus, they are important considerations in recruitment.How Does One Test a Telemental Health Intervention?To continue to move the field of couples and family telemental health forward, researchers must systematically rely on research strategies that achieve favorable balances between scientific rigor and clinical relevance.Control conditionsWhen designing a randomized clinical trial to evaluate a telemental health family or couple intervention, the first task is to select an appropriate control condition against which to compare the outcomes of the telemental health intervention. Here, we consider three primary options. First, “no-treatment” and “waitlist” controls assess the overall effect of the intervention but cannot meaningfully isolate the specific effects of the intervention or the effects of delivering the intervention via a videoconferencing portal.A second control condition is one in which participants receive the office-based format of the same treatment. Such a comparison benchmarks outcomes against the same intervention delivered in person, with a common hypothesis being that there will be no difference between the two groups (i.e., a noninferiority trial). In this design, an a priori decision is first made about the minimum difference between the conditions that would be meaningful enough to deem the groups nonequivalent (e.g., a 0.2 SD difference), and then tests are conducted to reject the null hypothesis that the observed difference between the two conditions is less than or equal to the a priori minimum difference deemed meaningful (see Rogers, Howard, & Vessey, 1993). The only component manipulated is the delivery format (Internet vs. face-to-face), as treatment content is held constant, and condition differences can be attributed exclusively to the modality of care. Other trials might hypothesize that the telemental health format will yield a significant improvement over a standard clinic-based format, and indeed some recent trials have found telemental health formats to outperform parallel clinic-based care for family problems (e.g., Comer, Furr, Miguel, et al., 2017).Despite the advantages and rigor inherent in comparing a telemental health intervention with a parallel office-based format of that same intervention, such a comparison requires that participants live close enough to the investigative team so that they can feasibly participate in office-based treatment if that is the condition to which they are assigned. Findings from such a trial may not generalize to the more geographically remote and underserved populations for whom telemental health formats are most needed. As Chou, Bry, and Comer (2017) note, in order to position technology-based treatments for optimal uptake and reach, research needs to examine these treatments in the very populations that they are envisioned to serve.Drawing on a “treatment as usual” (TAU) comparison—in which control participants are provided the standard of care that is routinely given to that population in their own community—increases the portability of a trial and allows the investigator to examine a telemental health couple or family intervention in more remote and underserved populations. Unlike trials comparing telemental health with the same treatment delivered in an office-based format, TAU comparisons do not require that participants live close enough to the investigative team so that they can feasibly participate in either treatment condition. Despite the benefits, however, what exactly constitutes TAU is difficult to operationalize as it varies widely across regions and settings, making it difficult to integrate findings across studies. Further, differences between a telemental health intervention and a TAU condition might be attributed to differences in provider training, quality, or supervision, or to differences in the frequency, duration, or intensity of care, rather than to differences in the treatment delivery format.OutcomesTesting telemental health couple and family interventions requires one to decide what dependent variables to assess and how to assess them. In addition to standard clinical trial outcomes (e.g., symptom responses, diagnostic responses, improvements in functioning and quality of life), investigators of telemental health couple and family interventions are particularly interested in assessing the acceptability and feasibility of the novel intervention format. Matters of treatment satisfaction and therapeutic engagement and alliance are critical. Moreover, investigators of telemental health are wise to assess technological barriers to care, including technology-related disruptions to treatment delivery as well as negative technology-related attitudes and poor technological literacy that can interfere with treatment engagement or moderate treatment responses.Finally, to facilitate subsequent cost-effectiveness analyses, one should record costs and savings associated with treatment delivery. These costs include, but are not limited to, technology to deliver the intervention (both client and therapist expenses), therapist salaries for initial training and ongoing treatment delivery, and supervisor salaries for training and ongoing supervision. Savings that will need to be recorded are beneficial effects of the program (on key outcome variables) as well as savings resulting from reductions in costs typically associated with in-person treatment (e.g., transportation, office space, child care, missed work or school).FundingThe research needed to evaluate the promise and potential of telemental health will be a very costly endeavor. As Chou, Bry, and Comer (2017) note, current federal funding priorities in mental health are focused on an experimental therapeutics agenda—in which conceptual mechanisms underlying intervention effectiveness and neurobiological treatment targets are often prioritized over examinations of treatment outcomes and innovative delivery formats. Researchers working to develop and evaluate telemental health interventions will need to be increasingly creative in order to secure needed funding. Industry partnerships and newer funding sources (e.g., the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute) may be critical for supporting the costly work needed.Telemental Health Interventions or BITs?Telemental health interventions hold great promise to transform the accessibility and scope of real-time mental health care with a provider by overcoming traditional geographic barriers and treating families in their natural settings. However, telemental health interventions for couples and families are not without limitations. Most notably, telemental health does not increase the overall number of individuals, couples, and families who can be treated at a given time. There is an enormous discrepancy between the large numbers in need of care and the relatively small numbers of providers. The discrepancy is so large that Kazdin and Blase (2011) estimated that even doubling the mental health workforce would yield only a minor public health impact. Using synchronous communication technologies to provide real-time services still requires a live provider for every session. As such, BITs that rely largely on self-administration and/or asynchronous communications with providers are better equipped than telemental health interventions to increase the number of individuals, couples, and families that can be treated.BITsAs described earlier, BITs either augment in-person treatment or provide self-help interventions without in-person treatment. Not surprisingly, BITs can take on many forms (Muñoz, 2017). Deciding which type of BIT suits a particular target population and intervention goals requires an understanding of the different practices.Automated BITsAutomated couple and family BITs omit therapist, coach, or staff support and rely solely on technology to provide the intervention to consumers. This category of automated BITs includes apps, websites, and/or phone lines that use voice or text recognition software to respond to client needs. Without the need for human support, automated BITs have the potential to reach limitless number of clients continuously as there is no need to coordinate schedules or limitation of staff hours. Additionally, the potential for translation of these programs into different languages can further increase their reach. The quality of the automated BIT can range from standardized information, such as learning about a particular disorder, to personalized prompts and feedback based on an array of previously entered or acquired data.Guided BITsIn guided BITs, like automated BITs, technology provides the majority of the couple and family intervention. However, guided BITs also include personal support in the form of a therapist or coach. There is great variety within guided BITs as to the quantity and intensity of human support provided, ranging from the high end of using therapists throughout the intervention to the low end of using trained staff to aid in technological issues on an as-needed basis. Compared with in-person delivery of services and telemental health, guided BITs have the potential to significantly decrease delivery costs, improve the reach of interventions across geographic boundaries, and increase the flexibility of services (e.g., online activities can be completed on the user’s schedule, not on the provider’s schedule). However, guided BITs still involve some staff contact and associated salary and training costs.Compared with automated BITs, guided BITs provide users with a greater sense of accountability, encouragement, and motivation to both complete and engage in program content. Users in guided BITs, compared with automated BITs, tend to report higher levels of satisfaction with the intervention (Aardoom et al., 2016). Additionally, within couple and family interventions, guided BITs show superior completion rates and clinical outcomes compared with automated BITs (Roddy, Nowlan, & Doss, 2016). However, with advancements in automated feedback (e.g., including, and tailored to, participants’ responses in the program), there is some emerging evidence that automated BITs are getting closer to guided BITs in their completion rates and clinical outcomes (e.g., Dear et al., 2015; Kelders Bohlmeijer, Pots, & van Gemert-Pijnen, 2015; Titov et al., 2015). Our sense is that, with improvements in technology, automated BITs may soon be able to provide contingent and personalized feedback rivaling that found in Guided BITs. What remains to be seen is how important the personal connection with a coach, absent in even the best automated BITs, is in encouraging program completion.Blended BITsBlended BITs can also be used to augment traditional in-person couple and family services rather than substitute for them. Many therapists are already utilizing BITs in this manner (often without labeling it as such) by encouraging clients to use cell phone apps to track behaviors, moods, or automatic thoughts between in-person sessions or to monitor sleep and activity with wearable technology (Muñoz, 2017). Augmented BITs are easy to incorporate into clinicians’ current practice and, for clients who are accustomed to using their phones or computers daily, may be more attractive than diaries or worksheets for completing homework assignments. Additionally, the supplemental reminders and practice have been shown to improve treatment outcomes (e.g., Jones et al., 2014). However, augmented BITs do little to increase the reach of interventions. Because clinicians incorporating blended BITs provide the majority of clinical work in face-to-face sessions, the level of training to provide quality intervention is equally as high as training an in-person provider who does not use BITs. Furthermore, the provider’s ability to interact with the client via BITs is limited by the provider’s availability, therapy training, and knowledge of the technology.How Does One Design and Implement a BIT?After deciding to build a couple or family BIT, there are multiple decision points in the design process. Below, we include several considerations and their implications for BIT design.Will the BIT Meet the Intended Need?To ensure that one’s vision is aligned with couples’ or families’ perceived needs, conducting a series of interviews is essential. The first two sets of interviews should consist of the target audience, with two sets being helpful to ensure that ideas converge across the two sets. In these interviews, open-ended questions should dominate: Do they see a need? If so, what? What would they want to address that need? What would they be willing (and not willing) to do to address that need? Toward the end of the interview, turning to more specific ideas for BIT content can be helpful. If one is contemplating building an augmented BIT, utilizing additional interviews with providers that will be assigning and utilizing the BIT is important.Who Will Be Using the BIT?With more than one user (e.g., both partners of a couple or coparenting team; a parent and child), one must consider which activities they will be doing together and which they will doing separately. Completing activities jointly allows for opportunities to discuss the material in the moment. However, joint completion also has its disadvantages. It may be more difficult for more than one person to view the content (if completed on a smartphone) and different reading speeds may create frustration. Working together may also limit each individual’s ability to reflect on their own internal experience, especially if users are asked to write in their responses. Completing the BIT together also requires both partners to be available and in the same place; in contrast, individual activities can be completed on the bus/train home from work or when parents work different schedules. Finally, if the dyad or family is experiencing conflict, joint completion of activities may increase the risk that the BIT would start an argument.In the BITs we have developed, we have found a mixture of individual and joint activities to be the most useful when more than one user is involved (Doss, Benson, Georgia, & Christensen, 2013). For example, in the OurRelationship BIT (Doss et al., 2016), both members of a distressed couple work together to select, understand, and then solve a relationship problem. The majority of each phase—where users view tailored feedback about their relationship and write about how the ideas apply to their own relationship—is completed individually. At the end of each phase, couples are brought together in a joint activity to have a structured conversation where the program displays portions of what users wrote during the individual activities and the couple is encouraged to discuss them. However, other online BITs for relationships encourage couples to complete all activities together to maximize opportunities for discussion (e.g., Braithwaite & Fincham, 2014). Therefore, the best balance of joint and individual activities will depend on the BIT’s content, purpose, and audience.Native Apps Versus Web-Based ProgramsNative apps, which are programs built for a particular device (usually a smartphone or tablet), have important advantages. They can be downloaded onto the device and subsequently used without an Internet connection. Native apps also tend to interact more seamlessly with a device’s other functionality, which can be important if GPS data, motion sensors, or related functionality is a central part of the BIT. However, native apps also have their disadvantages. At a minimum, two versions need to be built—one for the Apple operating systems (iPhone, iPad) and one for Android systems (Android smartphones such as Samsung); additionally, depending on the functionality the app needs to harness, it may be necessary to have different versions for smartphones and tablets even within the same operating system. Those multiple builds increase costs for initial build and maintenance and additional complexity in managing the resulting data.Web-based applications, in contrast, require an Internet connection (via a computer or smartphone) and cannot take as much advantage of the device’s functionality. However, using a device’s Internet browser, only a single version needs to be built (often at a lower cost than a single version of a native app), reducing both costs and complexity of a web-based BIT. In the rest of this article, we are going to focus on describing web-based guided BITs for two reasons: (a) currently, they are more cost effective for investigators seeking to develop their first BIT, and (b) we expect any information we would provide on native apps would become quickly outdated; in contrast, the recent rise of HTML5 as the dominant web language across devices and operating systems forecasts a relative stability of functionality required for web-based BITs.Necessary Components of a Web-Based BITIf a web-based BIT (instead of a native app) is the best fit, one must consider the requirements of the intervention content itself as well as the requirements of the platform in which the activities are housed.If one’s goal is to deliver an intervention with text, audio, video, and some interactivity (e.g., clicking, drag-and-drop interactions), there are several excellent and relatively inexpensive options available; at this time, we recommend Articulate (www.articulate.com), Adobe Captivate, and Lectora. With a larger initial budget, the Adapt open-source functionality (www.AdaptLearning.org) is a good option. Content in Adapt is “responsive” (displays different content or using different layouts based on the size of the device’s screen). Additionally, Adapt has more options to interact with an online database, facilitating saving and recalling complex variables (e.g., calculated formulas) across the user’s sessions in the BIT.In addition to the content of the BIT, one may also need to consider housing that content in a learner management system (LMS), such as Blackboard, Moodle, or Totara. An LMS allows one to require users to register for the intervention (restricting who has access to the content—critical for a randomized trial), make content availability contingent on completion of previous content, and tract usage of the content. An LMS will also be necessary if the online content needs to interface with a database—essential to save users’ responses in the program, to make content available across different sessions/devices, or to pull information from different accounts (e.g., allowing the wife to see a subset of the husband’s responses).The Role of Coaches in a Guided BITCoaches in a guided BIT tend to help users apply program content, reinforce fundamental skills, brainstorm solutions to any issues that may arise, and ensure that users are not misinterpreting content (Schueller, Tomasino, & Mohr, 2016). Coaches also provide a direct contact for technical assistance and problems with program functionality.The professional training level of coaches does not seem to impact clinical outcomes. For example, Titov et al. (2010) found no significant differences between technician-based and clinician-based support in a BIT for depression, with both significantly improving symptom outcomes more than a waitlist control group. This pattern suggests that professional support may not be necessary for BITs to function successfully (Titov et al., 2010), especially since many guided BITs are tightly scripted. As such, the use of paraprofessionals or graduate level trainees as coaches is both cost efficient and effective.Furthermore, less may actually be more when it comes to the frequency of coach support. Indeed, BITs with about 90 total minutes of coach contact throughout the course of the intervention have been shown to outperform BITs that used therapist support as primary delivery of program content, suggesting that more frequent contact might negatively impact consumer volition (Schueller et al., 2016). Therefore, Schueller and colleagues (2016) recommend that BITs include few and regularly spaced opportunities for coach support. For example, users in the OurRelationship BIT are able to complete online content at their own pace until they reach three program milestones, at which points they are asked to meet with their coach before continuing. This model helps to ensure that program content is well understood before it is applied and expanded upon in later modules, while at the same time allowing users considerable flexibility to complete activities on their own schedules during the interim.Contact modality, such as email, synchronous messaging, phone calls, and video conferencing, plays an important role in BIT adherence. Asynchronous emails have been found to help increase overall program use (Mohr et al., 2013); moreover, texts may be a more efficient medium than email (Schueller et al., 2016).How Does One Recruit for a BIT?For blended BITs, targeting the providers who will use the BIT will likely be the most efficient recruitment strategy; this type of recruitment approach is described in the Telemental Health Interventions section. For automated or guided BITs, effective recruitment strategies will likely include a combination of agreements with existing organizations and online recruitment targeting couples/families directly. If problem recognition and/or education about BITs is the advertising goal, then reaching out to the target audience—in person or online—is warranted. For example, on Facebook and using Google display ads, one can target potential participants based on their geographic location, race, ethnicity, education, income, and other interests/websites visited. In contrast, if one hopes to recruit samples who are already seeking help (but may or may not have decided to seek a BIT), then advertising where the population is likely to seek that help can be effective. For example, on online search engines such as Google and Bing, one can target advertisements to individuals’ searches related to presenting problems or interventions. If the BIT is an app, then advertising on the App Store and/or Google Play are natural ways to target individuals searching for apps related to your BIT.How Does One Test a BIT?There are four broad considerations in conducting an online randomized controlled trial (RCT) of a BIT—assessment, random assignment, study duration, and selection of appropriate control groups.AssessmentCurrently, the most popular online assessment programs are Qualtrics and SurveyMonkey; we suspect that most universities in the United States have an institutional subscription to one or the other. Both programs provide numerous question types and complex logic functionality. Alternatively, if a BIT is paired with an LMS, many eLearning software programs such as Articulate and Adapt include integrated assessment functionally (enhancing user experience); however, the functionality tends to be more limited than dedicated assessment functionality such as Qualtrics. Additionally, given the relatively high rate of attrition in BITs, it is important to conduct assessments early in the intervention to obtain estimates of change for all participants. These early data points can be used to reduce bias in subsequent data analyses.OutcomesAs described in detail in the Telemental Health Interventions section, measures of satisfaction and engagement are important for couple and family BITs as well. To construct cost-effectiveness estimates, in addition to the training and delivery costs detailed in the Telemental Health Interventions section, it is important to maintain accurate estimates of costs associated with initial development (and any subsequent refinement) of the BIT. Initial development costs for BITs are often significantly higher than ongoing costs to deliver the treatment and thus weigh heavily on cost estimates. In particular, costs associated with construction of the app/online content, LMS (if relevant), and online advertising should be recorded.DurationGiven the rapidly changing pace of technology, some authors have argued that it is inappropriate to restrict changes to an intervention during evaluation because, by the time the RCT is complete, the tested intervention is outdated (e.g., Mohr et al., 2015). If rapid recruitment is not possible, then authors have recommended conducting “trials of intervention principles” (Mohr et al., 2015) or sequential, multiple assignment, randomized trials (SMART designs; Collins, Nahum-Shani, & Almirall, 2014) that permit inclusion of alternative or updated versions of an intervention.Control ConditionsWhen selecting a control group for a BIT RCT, many of the same considerations apply as for in-person studies. However, when recruiting participants online, it is especially important to consider that any participants assigned to a control group will likely have other options (outside of the study) at their fingertips. To reduce the number of control couples or families who seek services elsewhere, it may be beneficial to make the control group a wait-list control group (if the waiting period is not too long) or a viable alternative treatment (either another active intervention or a placebo-control intervention).What Are Important Ethical/Legal Considerations in Delivering and Testing a BIT?Testing and delivering couple and family BITs adds several important ethical and legal considerations to those typically involved in face-to-face interventions.License JurisdictionIn many cases, a BIT can be considered a self-help intervention (with or without “coach,” not “therapist,” support) and thus does not require a license to deliver. However, if the BIT provides services that can be understood to represent the practice of psychology that would otherwise require a license to provide, then one must be careful that the therapist is licensed in the state or jurisdiction where participants reside. Issues of license jurisdiction are described in more detail in the Telemental Health Interventions section above.Online AssessmentIn conducting online assessments, one important consideration is whether your data will need to be Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) compliant (including the HITECH Act— “Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health” —and/or related Department of Health and Human Services rules). At the time of writing, both Qualtrics and SurveyMonkey require a premium level of services and a special contract that designates them as a Business Associate to be HIPAA compliant.VideoIf the couple or family intervention is subject to HIPAA regulations, then HIPAA-compliant video services need to be used. Although several are available, VSee is a provider that specializes in HIPAA-compliant videoconferencing at affordable rates. If an intervention is not subject to HIPAA, investigators should consider whether using a videoconferencing software that will be more familiar to users might be a better fit (especially for participants who are not technologically savvy). For example, FaceTime offers “end-to-end” encryption, meaning that Apple can not access the content of the calls. Conversations over Skype and Google Hangouts are encrypted; however, this encryption is not currently “end-to-end.”EmergenciesWhen concerning levels of domestic violence or suicidality are reported, we suggest participants should be immediately provided with both the website and phone number for the relevant hotline—either the National Domestic Violence Hotline or the National Suicide Prevention lifeline. Most assessment functionality allows for this contact information to be provided in real time in a conditional manner based on a user’s response to a previous item.Mandatory ReportingFinally, if implementing a couple or family BIT across state lines (or internationally), investigators must consider that mandatory reporting guidelines for child and elder abuse vary by state. There are several helpful compilations of state laws regarding child abuse (https://www.childwelfare.gov/topics/systemwide/laws-policies/state/) and elder abuse (https://ncea.acl.gov/whatwedo/policy/state.html).Technology’s Impact on the Conceptual Framework for Couple and Family InterventionsTo this point, we have focused on the impact that technology can have in improving the efficacy or reach of interventions for couples and families. However, it is also important to consider how technology can affect the field’s conceptual framework. First, the increased reach of technology-enhanced interventions allows for more diverse and larger samples of couples and families, which, in turn, permits testing treatment moderators such as race, ethnicity, acculturation, income, education, or type of relationship problems. For instance, despite guidance on how to tailor interventions for African American couples (e.g., Boyd-Franklin, Kelly, & Durham, 2008), there have been only a handful of studies that have examined differential outcomes by race or ethnicity (e.g., Doss et al., 2012; Rhoades, 2015).Second, technology allows us to collect new measures with increasing sophistication and specificity, improving our ability to identify and test mechanisms of our treatments. One of the central challenges of assessing mechanisms is that, to permit the strongest evidence of their role, mechanisms should be measured after they have been affected by the intervention but before they have a chance to change the ultimate outcome variable. Technology, with its ability to integrate more frequent measures of putative mechanisms, allows the opportunity to assess mechanisms without making a priori assumptions about the exact timeframe. More frequent assessments also increase the chance of detecting change in an individual before it affects the broader couple or family system. Additionally, technology increases the opportunities to collect implicit or behavioral measures (e.g., automated calculation of vocal stress during real-world conversations), increasing the chances that change in the mechanism can be captured before a participant can self-report on that change (and thus before it has the opportunity to affect the participant’s global evaluations).Third, the availability of technology-enhanced interventions may inform repackaging of our treatments. For example, in the individual adult literatures, transdiagnostic interventions have gained significant momentum (e.g., Sauer-Zavala et al., 2017); recent studies have further demonstrated that web-based transdiagnostic interventions seem to have similar effects across anxiety and depressive disorders (e.g., Dear et al., 2015; Titov et al., 2015). Although there have been recent calls to combine couple- and child-focused interventions, studies to date have utilized relatively small samples (e.g., Zemp, Milek, Cummings, Cina, & Bodenmann, 2016) which may have missed small- and medium-sized benefits of this combination. Furthermore, efforts to develop and test transdiagnostic interventions for youth (Queen, Barlow, & Ehrenreich-May, 2014) have been initiated but large-sample web-based studies would allow more detailed examination of these possibilities.ConclusionWe believe the role of technology in couple and family interventions is expanding rapidly; the question is no longer if technology integration can be helpful but how and when it can be helpful. Indeed, technology has enormous potential to improve the efficacy of our face-to-face interventions, facilitate skill acquisition and application to real-world settings, decrease provider burden, and expand the reach of our interventions to couples and families who would otherwise not receive services. However, technology is not a panacea; if utilized incorrectly or inappropriately, it could decrease the efficacy of our treatments and increase risks for our clients. In this article, we have identified key considerations and provided conceptual and methodological guidance for investigators in the successful development, refinement, and evaluation of their couple and family telemental health interventions or BITs. Although the relatively young field of technology-based and technology-facilitated treatments has already amassed an impressive initial base of knowledge, many of the most important answers are still ahead of us. As in any new area of study, advances have emerged quickly, and we are just now starting to see consistency in terminology and consensus in methodology. Research and development efforts need to stay agile in order to keep pace with the rapidly evolving possibilities of modern technology. The conceptual frameworks and perspectives on technology-based interventions outlined throughout this paper can serve to guide the next wave of needed innovation and research in a manner that maximizes both scientific rigor and clinical utility. Disruptive behavior disorders (DBDs) are among the most common disorders affecting young children (e.g., Egger & Angold, 2006), and when left untreated, are associated with complex and intractable trajectories over time (e.g., Lavigne et al., 2001). Guidelines suggest that psychosocial interventions, when available, should constitute first-line treatment (Comer et al., 2013; Eyberg et al., 2008). Behavioral parent training, in particular, has shown the strongest support (Comer et al., 2013; Eyberg et al., 2008; Kaminski et al., 2008). parent–child interaction therapy (PCIT; Eyberg & Funderburg, 2011) is one such supported parent-training program. Throughout treatment, parents practice positive attending and effective discipline while the therapist monitors family interactions from behind a one-way mirror and provides live coaching via a parent-worn bug-in-the-ear device.Despite treatment advances, barriers interfere with proper service access. Regional professional workforce shortages in mental health care impinge on the availability of services (Comer & Barlow, 2014). Transportation barriers and stigma-related concerns about going to a mental health facility (Owens et al., 2002) further limit the accessibility and acceptability of clinic-based services. Remote technologies are increasingly being leveraged to expand the reach and scope of children’s mental health care, given their potential to overcome traditional barriers to services and promote skill generalization by extending skill engagement beyond brick-and-mortar sessions (Comer & Barlow, 2014; Jones et al., 2013; Kazdin & Blase, 2011). However, applications to early child DBDs have been limited. To date, controlled evaluations in this area have only involved hybrid models that conduct most parent training in person, despite other treatment components being conducted remotely (Jones et al., 2014; Myers et al., 2015). Such programs are not fully liberated from the geographical obstacles that hinder service accessibility for many.Comer and colleagues (2015) have suggested that PCIT may be particularly amenable to a videoteleconferencing (VTC) format, given that, by design, the PCIT therapist is not in the same room as the family for most of the treatment, but rather is remotely monitoring from another room and providing real-time feedback to parent(s) via a parent-worn bug-in-the-ear device. With VTC, therapists can remotely provide in-the-moment feedback during parent–child interactions in the home, regardless of a family’s geographic proximity to a mental health clinic. Such Internet-delivered PCIT (I-PCIT) can afford a comparable quantity of therapist contact relative to standard, clinic-based PCIT. Moreover, treating families in homes may enhance the ecological validity of treatment by providing parent coaching in the very settings in which child behaviors are most problematic. VTC platforms are being increasingly used to remotely provide full courses of real-time treatment in the home for a number of clinical populations (e.g., Comer et al., 2017), although applications to early DBDs are limited.This is the first randomized trial evaluating VTC to offer fully remote behavioral parent training with a live therapist. Three–five-year olds with DBDs were randomly assigned to receive either I-PCIT or standard clinic-based PCIT. We hypothesized that I-PCIT would: (a) be associated with productive engagement and high treatment satisfaction; and (b) yield significant improvements maintained across a 6-month follow-up period. We further predicted that I-PCIT and standard clinic-based PCIT would yield similar outcome trajectories and response rates across time.MethodParticipantsRacially/ethnically diverse participants were 40 children ages 3–5 with a DBD defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed.; DSM–IV; APA, 1994) and their caregiver(s).

Table 2TABLES AND FIGUREStable/figure thumbnailTable 2. Overview of Included MeasuresView larger image > in this page > in new window> Download slidepresents a summary and description of measures included.TreatmentsPCIT (Eyberg & Funderburg, 2011) is a well-established, clinic-based, behavioral parent-training program for young children that places central emphasis on improving parent–child interaction patterns and the quality of parent–child relationships. PCIT draws on attachment and social learning theories to emphasize positive attention, consistency, problem-solving, and communication. Parents first learn to build a positive and rewarding parent–child relationship via positive attending skills and differential reinforcement, and then learn effective discipline strategies and time-out procedures. The precise length of PCIT for a given family is titrated to the quickness with which the family achieves mastery criteria. A distinguishing feature of PCIT is the use of in-session parent coaching. The therapist monitors the family from behind a one-way mirror and provides live and individualized coaching through a parent-worn bug-in-the-ear device.I-PCIT (Comer et al., 2015) follows traditional clinic-based PCIT, but uses a VTC platform to enable therapists to remotely deliver treatment to families in their homes. Instead of interacting in front of a one-way mirror at a clinic, families use a webcam to broadcast home-based interactions to their therapists, who remotely provide live coaching through a parent-worn Bluetooth earpiece. Technological, administrative, security, and hardware considerations for telemental health care are considered elsewhere (Chou et al., 2016; Comer et al., 2015).Procedure and Data AnalysisProcedures were approved by the Florida International University and Boston University institutional review boards and informed consent was obtained for all families. Participants were recruited from the flow of families seeking treatment for child-behavior problems at one of two university-affiliated clinics in [Miami, FL and Boston, MA]. Independent evaluators (IEs) masked to treatment condition conducted Kiddie-Disruptive Behavior Disorder Schedule (K-DBDS; Keenan, Wakschlag, & Danis, 2001) diagnostic interviews, and generated Clinical Global Impressions (CGI; Guy & Bonato, 1970) and Children’s Global Assessment Scale (CGAS; Shaffer et al., 1983) scores, at baseline, posttreatment, and 6-month follow-up. Diagnostic interviews were conducted in the clinic, regardless of treatment condition, to maintain the masked study design. Caregivers also completed parent-report forms at baseline, midtreatment, posttreatment, and 6-month follow-up online through a secure and encrypted Web-survey application. Families received $40 for each evaluation. Services were provided at no cost. To standardize care across I-PCIT participants, I-PCIT families were provided with a temporary equipment kit for the duration of their participation (∼$150; see Comer et al., 2015). Therapists (n = 9; seven women, two men; 22.2% ethnic/racial minority status) were clinical psychology trainees who completed yearly intensive didactic training with a PCIT master trainer, followed by cotreatment roles on two cases. Therapists self-completed session-integrity checklists, and session recordings were reviewed during weekly supervision with a clinical psychologist. The same therapists delivered treatment across conditions, and supervision groups simultaneously provided supervision for Internet and clinic-based cases. The lead supervisor also selected 36 random sessions (5% of the total 719 sessions conducted across the study) and completed independent treatment-integrity checks; treatment integrity was high (88%). IEs met internal certification and reliability procedures, developed with the K-DBDS lead author. IEs presented interview results to supervision and diagnoses and CGI/CGAS scores were collaboratively generated.Analyses were conducted on the intent-to-treat sample (N = 40). Baseline differences between groups were evaluated using t and χ2 tests, and linear regressions controlling for site and therapist-evaluated differences in treatment satisfaction and treatment barriers across groups. Hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) was conducted to model the nonindependence of data due to nesting of repeated observations (Level 1) within children (Level 2), using maximum-likelihood estimation of parameters to account for missing data (0% of data were missing at baseline; 12.5% at posttreatment; 32.5% at follow-up). HLM mixed-effects models accounted for missing data and used the data from the full intent-to-treat sample. For each HLM, treatment group, study site, therapist, the natural log (ln) of time (weeks since baseline), and the Group × ln(Time) interaction were fixed-effect predictors, and the intercept (scaled to the baseline assessment; i.e., time = 0) was the single random effect (allowing individuals to vary in their mean-outcome values). The MIXED procedure in SPSS 21 was used for mixed model analyses. Fitted models were used to calculate estimated mean scores at each time point. Clinical significance was evaluated with between- and within-subjects effect sizes (d), as well as by examining rates of posttreatment and follow-up treatment response (CGI-Improvement = 1 or 2), excellent response (CGI-Improvement = 1), diagnostic response to baseline principal diagnosis, and diagnostic response to all DBDs. Intent-to-treat analyses on responder rates were based on an assumption that cases of posttreatment or follow-up missing data were not responders. For each responder type, binomial logistic regressions (controlling for site and therapist) examined whether condition predicted response rate.ResultsFigure 1TABLES AND FIGUREStable/figure thumbnailFigure 1.

There were no significant differences in age, sex, race/ethnicity, income, or baseline child-behavior problems between families who did and did not participate in post/follow-up assessments. Treatment retention was high, with 70% of families in each condition completing their full treatment course. Among families completing treatment, the mean number of sessions until achieving PCIT mastery criteria was 21.2 (SD = 7.4); number of sessions did not differ across conditions (MInternet = 21.7 vs. MClinic = 20.8), t(26) = 0.35, p = .73. Treatment satisfaction was high across both conditions, as rated on the Client Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ-8; Larsen et al., 1979; MInternet = 30.1 vs. MClinic = 28.5; highest possible score = 32) and the Therapy Attitude Inventory (TAI; Brestan et al., 1999; MInternet = 45.9 vs. MClinic = 45.1; highest possible score = 50). Treatment condition did not predict posttreatment, CSQ-8 F(3, 29) = .71, p = .50; βCondition = −1.63, p = .25, or TAI scores F(3, 29) = 1.57, p = .23; βCondition = −1.23, p = .48. I-PCIT was associated with fewer barriers to treatment participation than clinic-based PCIT, F(3, 29) = 7.62, p < .001; βCondition = 8.40, p = .01, MInternet = 50.1 versus MClinic = 58.5.Treatment Outcomes Across TimeTable 3TABLES AND FIGUREStable/figure thumbnailTable 3.

For child-behavior problems and burden to caregivers, there was a significant effect of time (see Table 4). Specifically, across conditions, Eyberg Child Behavior Inventory (ECBI; Eyberg & Pincus, 1999) Intensity, Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL; Achenbach & Rescorla, 2000) Externalizing, and ECBI Problem scores significantly improved across time. Change leveled off somewhat between posttreatment and follow-up. Figure 2TABLES AND FIGUREStable/figure thumbnailFigure 2.

Average timing of the midtreatment evaluation = 17.2 weeks postbaseline; average timing of posttreatment evaluation = 35.2 weeks postbaseline; average timing of the follow-up evaluation = 56.9 weeks postbaseline.

Across these three outcomes, there were no significant interaction effects of Time×Condition. In contrast, across conditions, global severity and functioning (CGI-Severity; Guy & Bonato, 1970 and CGAS; Shaffer et al., 1983, respectively) did not improve across time (see Table 4).Clinical SignificanceTable 5TABLES AND FIGUREStable/figure thumbnailTable 5. Clinical Significance of Child Outcomes at Posttreatment and at 6-Month Follow-UpView larger image > in this page > in new window> Download slide(top) presents within-subjects effect sizes (d) across outcomes, by treatment condition. Effects for child-behavior problems and burden to caregivers from pre-to-post and from pre-to-follow-up were all “large” to “very large” (Cohen, 1988; Sawilowsky, 2009) for I-PCIT and “medium” to “very large” for clinic-based PCIT. Nonsignificant between-groups effects were relatively negligible in magnitude (see Table 5, middle). Among children who completed a full course of treatment (n = 28), 85.7% of I-PCIT children and 78.6% of clinic-based PCIT children were treatment responders (i.e., CGI-Improvement = 1 or 2) at posttreatment; 83.3% of I-PCIT treatment completers and 72.7% of clinic-based PCIT treatment completers were treatment responders at follow-up. Moreover, among children who completed a full course of treatment, 50% of I-PCIT children and 17.6% of clinic-based PCIT children were “excellent responders” (i.e., CGI-Improvement = 1) at posttreatment; 33.3% of I-PCIT treatment completers and 25.0% of clinic-based PCIT treatment completers were “excellent responders” at follow-up. Responder rates for intent-to-treat analyses found strong treatment response rates at posttreatment across conditions and somewhat lower response rates at follow-up (see Table 5, bottom). Diagnostic response rates are also presented in Table 5 (bottom). The rate of posttreatment excellent response (CGI-Improvement = 1) was significantly higher in I-PCIT than in clinic-based PCIT (see Table 5, bottom). Other response rates were equivalent across conditions.DiscussionThe present study provides the first evidence from a controlled trial supporting the use of real-time VTC to remotely deliver behavioral parent training to the home setting. After treatment, intent-to-treat analyses found that 70% of children treated with I-PCIT showed treatment response, and at 6-month follow-up, 55% continued to show treatment response. Further, roughly half of the children treated with I-PCIT no longer met criteria for a DBD at posttreatment or at 6-month follow-up. The effects of I-PCIT on children’s symptoms and burden to parents were large-to-very-large in magnitude, and important to note, these outcomes and symptom trajectories were comparable to those observed in children randomized to standard clinic-based PCIT. Of note, the rate of excellent response at posttreatment was significantly higher in youth treated with I-PCIT relative to those treated with clinic-based PCIT, and parents treated with I-PCIT perceived fewer barriers to their treatment participation than parents treated with clinic-based PCIT. These findings build on the small but growing literature supporting the promising role of remote technologies for expanding the delivery of behavioral parent training (Jones et al., 2014; Kirkman et al., 2016; Myers et al., 2015), and add to broader efforts leveraging new technologies to expand the reach and scope of indicated mental health care (Comer & Barlow, 2014; Kazdin & Blase, 2011).Relative to other evaluated technology-based programs that incorporate real-time behavioral parent training, I-PCIT is novel in its use of VTC to remotely deliver all parent training components. Indeed, I-PCIT is fully liberated from the geographical constraints that limit the accessibility of hybrid models forming the basis of much of the behavioral parent training in the clinic. Important to note, in addition to positive child outcomes, we found I-PCIT to be associated with high engagement and treatment satisfaction, and reduced perceived barriers to participation relative to clinic-based PCIT. With continued support in geographically diverse populations, I-PCIT may play an important role in overcoming geographic barriers to care for those living in rural, remote, or otherwise underserved regions characterized by limited local treatment options. For those in regions with access to quality care, research is needed to examine the relative merits of emerging technology-based treatment options to identify for whom technology-enhanced treatments might best be suited (i.e., technology could be used to extend in-session content beyond the treatment hour (as Jones et al., 2014 suggested) versus telemental health formats like I-PCIT in which all of the treatment is conducted remotely in real time. Moreover, the present findings that, (a) the rate of posttreatment excellent response was significantly higher among youth treated with I-PCIT than clinic-based PCIT, and (b) I-PCIT was associated with fewer parent-perceived barriers to participation than clinic-based PCIT, underscore the important role I-PCIT can play, even in regions with access to quality clinic-based parent training.Of note, although I-PCIT may address geographic disparities, the reliance on live sessions with a provider means that I-PCIT alone cannot solve broader mental health-care workforce-power problems (Kazdin & Blase, 2011). Even after addressing geographic workforce disparities, there is still an enormous discrepancy between the large numbers of individuals in need of care and the relatively small numbers of providers delivering care. Lower intensity, technology-based treatment options are needed to buttress real-time technology-based treatments. Self-administered e-health programs that have parents watch recorded parent-training modules have shown initial promise in open trials (Kirkman et al., 2016), sometimes with additional telephone-based support (Sourander et al., 2016). Such approaches will likely play an important role in stepped-care models that reserve higher intensity treatments requiring extensive provider time for more severe cases.Study limitations merit comment. First, the sample size in this initial trial of VTC methods for remotely delivering parent training to the home may have been underpowered to detect between-groups differences, although within-subjects analyses did yield significant and sizable results and significant differences were found in rates of excellent response and barriers to treatment. Continued studies with larger samples incorporating noninferiority designs are needed to examine issues of comparability between treatments. Second, the comparison to standard clinic-based PCIT offered a conservative I-PCIT evaluation, benchmarking it against the same treatment delivered in person, but this comparison also required participants to live close enough to one of the two recruitment sites so they could feasibly participate in either of the treatment conditions as assigned. Accordingly, although I-PCIT itself was an entirely remote format, the present findings may not generalize to the more geographically remote and underserved populations for whom VTC formats may be particularly necessary (see Chou, Bry, & Comer, 2017). Research comparing I-PCIT to usual care in rural populations is needed, given that technology access may differ across regions. Third, we provided equipment kits to I-PCIT families so differences in treatment response could not be attributed to differences in household technology. Although many families already own sufficient equipment for I-PCIT, some participants who benefited from I-PCIT may not have independently owned proper equipment to participate in I-PCIT outside of this study. Fourth, we presently focused on the main outcomes of I-PCIT; examination of other outcomes and mediators, such as parent stress, parent–child interactions, and parenting practices, was beyond the scope of this analysis. Fifth, inclusion criteria focused on parent reports and IE assessments, and did not directly incorporate teacher/daycare-provider reports. Although the K-DBDS (Keenan et al., 2001) assesses symptoms across multiple settings, incorporating direct teacher/daycare-provider assessments might have yielded a more representative sample of DBD youth. Finally, families lacking Internet accessibility will not be able to benefit from I-PCIT. Almost half of participating families reported annual incomes over $100,000. Encouragingly, the overwhelming majority of U.S. families now have Internet access, and digital divides based on income, race, and age are steadily disappearing (Pew Research Center, 2015).Despite limitations, this study offers the first controlled evaluation of VTC to offer fully remote behavioral parent training to the home setting with a live therapist, and provides support for the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of I-PCIT. Although behavioral parent-training programs are well-supported and recommended as first-line treatment for early onset DBDs, problems remain in the accessibility of quality care. Against a concerning backdrop of reduced availability of and reliance on psychosocial treatments in preschool-aged youth and increased pharmacological intervention for DBDs in the absence of relevant controlled evaluations (Comer et al., 2010; Olfson et al., 2010), the present findings underscore the urgency to overcome reimbursement challenges to telemental health and improve dissemination of technology-based care that can transform the reach of indicated care. \""
